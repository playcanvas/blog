The **PlayCanvas** **Community** is growing all the time and we know that some of that growth is down to your hard work in **promoting** the engine.

Last month we introduced our **DevLog** to help strengthen the PlayCanvas Community and this month the **Referrals feature** is our way of saying thank you for **using** and **sharing** our engine. PlayCanvas simply wouldn't work without you, our Community.

### **How Does It Work?**

Simply **share your [unique Referral link](https://playcanvas.com/account)** where and when you please and if a user signs up to **PlayCanvas **using your link, you are **entitled to 5% of everything that they buy and sell on PlayCanvas over the period of 1 year**. The more people that sign up with the link that you shared, the more benefits you will receive.

The 5% you are entitled to is also based on the new users subscription fee.
