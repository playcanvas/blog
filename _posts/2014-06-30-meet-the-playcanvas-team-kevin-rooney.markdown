In our latest instalment of this series we chat to Kevin, [PlayCanvas](http://playcanvas.com)' Creative Director from Sligo, Ireland

**How did you get into the video games industry?**

I developed educational language games in a previous start-up, but had always wanted to get involved in real games. PlayCanvas was my chance.

**Can you briefly describe you role at PlayCanvas?**

I’m the Creative Director, so I look after the design side of things. We are just getting warmed up!

**Favourite aspect of PlayCanvas' service?**

I think creating games is a very natural and intuitive thing for people to do, but often with creating computer games the technical aspects can make it seem like a mysterious beast. PlayCanvas is dropping this barrier bit by bit and that’s something I really like.

**How is PlayCanvas changing the way people make games?**

It’s pretty amazing to have one code base for these games, so it can be played on multiple device types and shared around with just a link. That’s pretty powerful stuff in a world full of different devices and operating systems.

**Where do you see web based gaming in the future?**

Probably firing laser beams from its eyeballs at passing games consoles throughout the galaxy.

**Describe one interesting thing about yourself?**

When I was 17, I represented Ireland in Basketball for a number of years! _(Editor note: Kevin and [Vaios](http://blog.playcanvas.com/meet-the-playcanvas-team-vaios-kalpias-illias-2/)’ ‘mano e mano’ Shoot-out is coming to a court near you)_

The Quick Fire round (this is where things get a little interesting)

Zelda or Final fantasy?

Zelda

**COD or Battlefield? **

Battlefield

**Mario or Sonic?**

Mario

**Favorite game of all time?\*\*** \*\*

Oooooo tricky. I have lots of those. At the moment it's [Battlefield 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_4), but only when my friends are playing at the same time!

**Greatest Gaming Achievement?**

Being part of the team that made [Swooop](http://swooop.playcanvas.com/)!!
