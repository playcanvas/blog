Calling all Game Developers!

PlayCanvas’ first ever PLAYHACK is upon us and that can only mean a whole month's worth of fun and some incredible game developing.

### How does it work?

PLAYHACK starts today! We'll provide you with a 3D model and your mission is to turn it into a game. The only rule: you must use the model somewhere in your game.

It works like this:

1. **Fork [this month's project](https://playcanvas.com/playcanvas/gamejam-nov-14) into your account**

2. **Use the project and it's contents to build a new game.**

3. **Post to your [devlog](http://blog.playcanvas.com/the-devlog-playcanvas-community-feature/) about your game throughout the month**

4. **At the end of the month we'll look through all the projects that were forked from the original.**

5. **We'll pick our favorite and feature it on the front page of PlayCanvas for everyone to see.**

### The Model

This month you get to build your game around this uber-cool, **sci-fi hover tank!**

[![tank](https://blog.playcanvas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tank.jpg)](http://blog.playcanvas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tank.jpg)

Other than incorporating the model your game can be made and presented in any way that you like, whether it be **overhead **or **side-scrolling**, **s\*\***hooter** or **adventure\*\*.

### Judging

The process of judging will be as broad as the rules. You won't be marked on the strength of code, graphics or theme, the winning game will be the project that we enjoy the most. Simple.

We will be holding things down here at HQ during the month long jam by sharing some of the **best screen shots**, **DevLogs** and **general updates** of your progress.

### Featured Winner

On the **1st December** we will judge your projects and our favorite will be **featured** on the **PlayCanvas** **front \*\***page\*\*!
