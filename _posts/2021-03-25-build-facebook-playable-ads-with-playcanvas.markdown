PlayCanvas are very excited to announce official support for Facebook Playable Ads! ðŸš€

### What are Playable Ads?

Playable ads are small, interactive previews of a game or app that give a taste of the experience before the user choses to download it. These ads from Facebook are normally shown in the news feed or with â€˜rewarded adsâ€™ in other games and apps in exchange for an in-game/app reward.

[Facebook case studies](https://www.facebook.com/business/success/categories/playable-ads) consistently show that playable ads:

- Increase click-through rates
- Increase install conversion over traditional ads
- Increase return on ad spend
- Reduce cost per install

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 15px">
    <img src="/assets/media/playable-ad-bitmoji-creator.gif" style="width: 32%;" alt="Bitmoji Creator" />
    <img src="/assets/media/playable-ad-cube-jump.gif" style="width: 32%;" alt="Cube Jump" />
    <img src="/assets/media/playable-ad-flappy-bird.gif" style="width: 32%;" alt="Flappy Bird" />
</div>

Combine that with the [fully featured PlayCanvas game engine](https://playcanvas.com/features) which includes:

- Best in class visual editor with live updates across multiple devices
- 3D models and animation with physically based rendering (PBR)
- 2D animated sprites
- Responsive user interface authoring

And you have a very powerful combination to create fantastic and engaging experiences to reach your audience.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 15px">
    <img src="/assets/media/editor-bmw.gif" style="width: 49%;" alt="BMW in Editor" />
    <img src="/assets/media/editor-robostorm.gif" style="width: 49%;" alt="Robostorm in Editor" />
</div>

### Sounds great! How do I get started?

Weâ€™ve published the [official exporter tool on GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/playcanvas-rest-api-tools#converting-a-project-into-a-single-html-file) with instructions in our [User Manual Documentation](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/publishing/playable-ads/fb-playable-ads/). Itâ€™s very simple to set up!

Once configured, creating the file(s) for upload to Facebook is **just a single command**, shown in real time below.

That is how quick and easy it is! ðŸ’ª And it supports both the single 2MB HTML and 5MB zip bundle formats used by Facebook. ðŸ™Œ
