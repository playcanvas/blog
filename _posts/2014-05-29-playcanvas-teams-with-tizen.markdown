Another exciting day at PlayCanvas Towers! PlayCanvas and Tizen have formerly announced a partnership, with PlayCanvas joining the Tizen Association Partner Program. So what does all this mean? Let's start with a little bit about Tizen.

[Tizen](www.tizen.org) is an open source project managed by the Linux Foundation. The goal of the project is to build and support a cross-architecture, open source software platform that spans multiple device segments, including smartphone, tablet, Smart TV, appliances, netbook and in-vehicle infotainment systems. The [Tizen Association](www.tizenassociation.org) is an industry consortium of operators, device manufacturers and their suppliers, independent software developers and mobile application developers.

Ryoichi Sugimura, a Tizen Association Board Member from NTT DOCOMO, kindly gave us a very warm welcome to the Tizen family today: “I am delighted to welcome PlayCanvas to our ever-growing membership. Their contribution will support the development of the Tizen OS and ecosystem, and further drive Tizen’s vision of building and supporting a cross-architecture, open source software platform that spans across multiple device segments.”

More specifically, you can now count Tizen as an officially supported target for your PlayCanvas games. Tizen has absolutely awesome HTML5 and WebGL support so you can be sure performance will be stellar and your games will translate with minimal fuss. In the coming days, we will add a Tizen publishing guide to our documentation. In the meantime, if you want to get started with the platform, why not [download the SDK](https://developer.tizen.org/downloads/tizen-sdk) and try the simulator.

We want to hear about your experiences getting your PlayCanvas creations running on Tizen. So head to the [forums](https://forum.playcanvas.com/) and tell us all about it!
