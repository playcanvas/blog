Today we're pleased to launch **Organizations** for PlayCanvas users along with an updated and simplified set of plans including unlimited projects and more storage.

## Organizations

An organization offers you a convenient way to manage users and projects for businesses or for larger projects. With an organization you can specify multiple administrators who can add and remove users with project based permissions. Additionally, organization plans come with a convenient single invoice for your business.

## New Plans

Our new plans offer big bonuses over our previous plans including unlimited projects and increased storage.

Previously we offered 7 different plans with an array of options which has led to confusion in the past. Today, we're simplifying our plans down to just 3 and you'll be pleased to hear they include a big increase in the number of projects you can make and storage. Here's what the new plans look like:

We now offer two paid plans and the biggest change you'll see is that they both have **Unlimited Private Projects** and a big boost in storage space. The second change is that they both follow a simple per-seat model so you only pay for the number of people in your team.

The **Free** plan is great for getting started, learning about PlayCanvas or making your first few applications. With a free plan you can make an unlimited number of public projects and there are no limits on how many other users you can add to your public projects.

If it's just you but you want to work with private projects, the **Personal **plan is ideal**.** This plan is great for individual developers or for small teams. It is just $15 per user/month, you can make unlimited private projects and you get 1 GB storage for your assets. The Personal plan is also required if you want to download the HTML of your project and host it on your own server.

If you're using PlayCanvas for your business, the **Organization** plan is for you. With this plan you can manage your team members, remove the PlayCanvas loading screen and more features like offline archiving for your projects. The Organization plan costs $50 per user/month and you get 10 GB storage for your assets.
