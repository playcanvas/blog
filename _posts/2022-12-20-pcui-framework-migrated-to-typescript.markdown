[PCUI](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui) is the open source, front-end framework for building amazing web-based tools like the PlayCanvas Editor, [glTF Viewer](https://playcanvas.com/viewer?load=https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.playcanvas.com/models/IridescentDishWithOlives.glb), [Texture Tool](https://playcanvas.com/texture-tool) and more!

Today, we are excited to announce the release of [PCUI version 2.10.0](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui/releases/tag/v2.10.0)! This new release includes a number of significant updates and improvements that will make building web tools with PCUI even easier and more efficient.

One of the biggest changes in this release is the migration of the entire source code from JavaScript to TypeScript. This will provide a number of benefits to developers, including improved type checking, better code completion and IntelliSense in IDEs, and easier maintenance and refactoring of code.

In addition to the source code migration, we have also released a new [API reference manual](https://playcanvas.github.io/pcui/typedocs/) built with Typedoc. This will make it easier for developers to understand and use the various APIs and components available in PCUI.

TypeScript developers will also be pleased to know that we have improved the TypeScript declarations in this release, making it even easier to use PCUI in a TypeScript project.

Finally, we want to highlight the open source nature of PCUI. We believe in the power of the open source community to build great software together, and we encourage open source developers to get involved with the project. Whether you want to contribute code, report issues, or just provide feedback, we welcome your participation. Explore the [PCUI repo](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui) today on GitHub!

Thank you for using PCUI, and we hope you enjoy the new release!
