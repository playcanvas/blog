**If spending part of your December making a festively themed game doesn't get you in the mood for the Christmas season, we don't know what will.**

Its December 2014 and before the year is out we have a festive game jam for you to test your skills in.

## **How does it work?**

PLAYHACK starts today! We'll provide you with a 3D model and your mission is to turn it into a game. The only rule: you must use the model somewhere in your game.

It works like this:

1. **Fork [**this month's project**](https://playcanvas.com/playcanvas/playhack-dec-14)\*\*** into your account\*\*

2. **Use the project and it's contents to build a new game.**

3. **Post to your **[**devlog**](http://blog.playcanvas.com/the-devlog-playcanvas-community-feature/)** about your game throughout the month**

4. **At the end of the month we'll look through all the projects that were forked from the original. **

5. **We'll pick our favorite and feature it on the front page of PlayCanvas for everyone to see.**

## **The Model**

We are giving **you the reins** (get it?), to take the game wherever you want. Well almost. Incorporating the sack and present is optional, but you must use the** Jolly Santa model** (complete with sleigh and Rudolph).

Whether its an endless **side scroller** or an intense** racing game**, you can use this month's model to create any game that you like.

Look out for another series of tutorial blog posts coming soon to give you some ideas coming soon.

## **Judging**

The process of judging will be as broad as the rules. You won't be marked on the strength of code, graphics or theme, **the winning game will be the project that we enjoy the most**. Simple.

We will be holding things down here at HQ during the month long jam by **sharing** some of the best **screen shots**, **DevLog entries** and **general updates** of your progress.

## **Featured Winner**

On the **1st of January** we will judge your projects and our favourite will be **featured on the PlayCanvas landing page!**

## **Last Month**

With **ramps**, **barrels**, **hyper speed turrets** and **explosions**, last month's PlayHack was crazy (in the best way possible).

Our favourite entry is [SRL](http://apps.playcanvas.com/lizzip/gamehack/SRL) by PlayCanvas users [lizzip](https://playcanvas.com/lizzip) and [auroraimortalis](https://playcanvas.com/auroraimortalis), whose sci-fi maze game really impressed us using security camera's, laser doors and the Hover Tank acting as the villain. Amazing!

Honourable mentions go to PlayCanvas users [**Crefossus**](http://apps.playcanvas.com/crefossus/pewpew/alpha002) and [**Daniel Petterson**](http://apps.playcanvas.com/danielpettersson/hack/tank) for their games, but thank you to everyone who took part. We can't wait to see what you can come up with this month!
