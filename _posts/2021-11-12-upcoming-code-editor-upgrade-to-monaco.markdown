We have almost completed work on moving the Code Editor from Code Mirror to [Monaco](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor), the same editor that powers the ever popular, Visual Studio Code.

With this upgrade, it will give developers:







  * Much better performance, especially with large text files
  * More editing functionality through the command palette
  * Mouse driven features such as Cmd/Ctrl + Click to jump to definition, hover for documentation and a context menu!

There will be some small differences which will include: 







  * Syntax color changes as we've opted to use Monaco's default theme, which should be comfortably familiar to VS Code users
  * Some hotkeys/shortcuts will be different (e.g moving a line up/down)






### When can we use it?







We are still working through a few issues but planning to release the Editor as early as next week. Keep your eyes peeled!
