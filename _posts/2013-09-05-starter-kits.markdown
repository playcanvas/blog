Get hacking on a game instantly with our Platformer and FPS starter kits.

Today we've launched a new feature to help get you up and running in PlayCanvas super-quick. Instead of starting with the dreaded blank project, now you can instantly get yourself a game to start hacking on.

We've got two styles of game to start with. You can use a starter kit [right now](https://playcanvas.com/depot/create), or go to your profile, select **Create New Project** and select the Starter Kit from the top.

This is just the first two we've got up and running, with more improvements to come. Head over to the [forum](https://forum.playcanvas.com) with suggestions for more starter kits.
