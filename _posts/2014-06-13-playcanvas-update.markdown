**After a busy week here in the PlayCanvas office, we thought what better way to champion our efforts than to give you a taste of whats happened at HQ. We plan to start a series of weekly updates so you know what is keeping [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) at its best. This week; **

- We completely reworked our back-end API. All page loads are now 50% to 1000% times quicker.
- We have also made an improvement to the maneuverability of Entities as we introduced a new default Snap option. This function allows you to move incrementally within the PlayCanvas Designer (find more information on the Snap function [here](http://blog.playcanvas.com/snappy-new-update/)).
- Lastly we are happy to introduce a brand new platform starter kit which features a contribution from the artist who worked with us on [Swooop!](http://swooop.playcanvas.com/) (read all about it [here](http://blog.playcanvas.com/platform-game-starter-kit/http://blog.playcanvas.com/platform-game-starter-kit/)).
