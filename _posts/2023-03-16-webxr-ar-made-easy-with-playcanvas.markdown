[WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev/) is a technology that powers immersive and interactive AR and VR experiences to be accessed through supported web browsers. This allows us to build memorable, engaging content and share them with just a URL. No installs needed!

The starter kit comes with all you need to kickstart your AR experience for WebXR including:

- Real world light estimation
- AR shadow renderer
- AR object resizing and positioning controls
- Physics raycasting
- And more!

Look how quickly you can create AR experiences below!
