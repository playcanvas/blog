It's a big day over at PlayCanvas towers. We have a new programmer. In fact our first full-time staffer after the founding team.

Vaios joins us from sunny Athens, land of gods, fine olive oil and greeks bearing gifts [Best you could come up with!? - Ed]. More importantly he's got loads of experience writing games and tools for game developers. He spent a number of years working at Sony Computer Entertainment in London on the sadly un-released AAA action title [Eight Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Days), and the ground-breaking console virtual world PlayStation Home. Since then he's been working another [virtual world](http://www.playtown-game.com/playtown/app/portal/) title in Athens.

Join us in welcoming Vaios on [twitter](https://twitter.com/vkalpias), he'll going to be big part in helping PlayCanvas become the game development platform of the future.
