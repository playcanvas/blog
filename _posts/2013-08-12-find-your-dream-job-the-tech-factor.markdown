Want to work for one of the hottest startups in London?

PlayCanvas is one of 11 companies shaking up the London startup scene. Our goal is to re-invent how video games are built, shared and played, and to do this we are building a world class team. Finding amazingly talented people is hard but, as usual, the Techstars crew have the answer:

On Saturday, 17th August 2013, Techstars is holding a very special recruitment event at the headquarters of PlayFair Capital in London's Clerkenwell district. So if you're looking for a new challenge or just want to find out about life on the startup scene, come and meet us in person.  During the event, we will be taking the opportunity to demo the latest and greatest build of PlayCanvas. We think you'll be impressed!
