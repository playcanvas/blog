### Asset Folders

In case you missed it. We've made [huge improvements](https://blog.playcanvas.com/better-asset-management/) to asset management in the Editor. Folders and tags mean you can organize your assets nicely both in the editor and at runtime.

### Performance Profiler

With mobile forming such a large part of the web these days, performance is more critical than ever before. That's why we've released an awesome [profiling tool](https://blog.playcanvas.com/performance-matters-introducing-the-playcanvas-profiler/) to help quickly get to the bottom of performance problems and get your app running **fast**.

### Model Asset Metadata
