Today, we plugged a magical [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) device into one of our USB ports and fired up PlayCanvas.

[![leap-motion](https://blog.playcanvas.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/leap-motion1.png)](http://blog.playcanvas.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/leap-motion1.png)

30 minutes and [20 lines of code](http://playcanvas.com/will/leapmotion/editor/leaphand.js) later, we had a fun little demo app that shows the power of the device.
