This last week was frenzy of activity from the PlayCanvas founders. Trekking all over the UK to teach new people about PlayCanvas with demos and workshops.

### Thursday

On Thursday I went up to the [Confetti Institute of Creative Technologies](http://confetti.uk.com) in Nottingham and gave a workshop to a room full of interested developers. We covered the basics of a 3D engine, some quick samples of how Graphics, Camera, Physics and Audio can be used, and the we ended the 3 hour session with a the entire group building a the [Luna Lander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQQCfd1xEKg) demo that we showed you a few weeks ago.

At the end of the session everyone had had a great time and had a playable game to show for it.

### Friday

On Friday we were demoing at the Open Arcade in Nottingham town centre. The Open Arcade was an amazing space put together by the GameCity organizers to let game developers show off they're work and also provided a communal place for playing the latest and upcoming independent game releases.

### Sunday

On Sunday, our other co-founder Will, held a short session at the [Mozilla Festival](http://mozillafestival.org/) in London.

Again a room full of people got a quick introduction to HTML5 Game Engines and 3D game development. Then they dived in and this time built a working version of Pong, like in our other [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeR-flW-ojw).
