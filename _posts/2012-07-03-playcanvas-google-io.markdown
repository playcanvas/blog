A massive thank you to everybody who took the time to swing by our stand at Google I/O last week. We had an amazing time and hope you did too. If you weren't at the conference, here's our space in the Developer Sandbox:

We were really excited to be showing our latest game/demo: a networked multiplayer, third person shooter. We were running MacBook Pro and a ChromeBook connected to a node.js server. We think we did a great job of showing just what's possible with HTML5 (and WebGL) with only moderate hardware. Expect some more info soon on the near-term plans we have for the demo...
