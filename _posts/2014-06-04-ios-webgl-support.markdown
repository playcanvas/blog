Looks like [Will was right](https://blog.playcanvas.com/apple-embraces-webgl/) with his predictions for the Apple announcements at WWDC. Our friends at [Ludei](http://ludei.com) have [confirmed](http://blog.ludei.com/webgl-ios-8-safari-webview/) that WebGL is supported on iOS devices.

This is great news for PlayCanvas users who can now deploy games to every major browser, whether mobile or desktop.
