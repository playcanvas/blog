Last night I presented at the [London HTML5 Game Dev meetup](http://www.meetup.com/London-HTML5-Game-Developers/). As usual we had an awesome time and if you're based in or around London then you should definitely try and get along to the next one.

It was an overview of the ammo.js the physics engine we use internally for PlayCanvas and should be an interesting read for anyone who isn't totally familiar with what a physics engine is or does. It gives a nice overview of the different parts that make up a full physics engine and includes a bunch of demos about what is possible with PlayCanvas.
