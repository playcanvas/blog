<br>_Play Dungeon Fury in mobile and desktop browsers now_

Something incredibly exciting is happening in the mobile browser space right now. WebGL is rapidly being integrated into browsers and all of a sudden, game developers have the technologies they need to deliver high quality 3D video games without having to deploy a native app. To show what is possible today, PlayCanvas has developed the game 'Dungeon Fury', a light-hearted fantasy game that pushes your reflexes to the limit. Dungeon Fury represents the world's first 3D HTML5 browser game that is built specifically for mobile (although it works great in desktop browsers too!). And if all this wasn't cool enough, the whole game was written using only a web browser, made possible with the PlayCanvas game engine!

PlayCanvas on mobile is built upon bleeding edge technologies and as such, the game is pushing mobile browsers very hard indeed. Consequently there are some known issues and things to look out for. Supported mobile browsers are as follows:

- Firefox for Android

  - The game works in the Release Channel build but performance is far higher in the [Nightly Channel](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/android/#nightly).

- Chrome for Android

  - WebGL needs to be enabled by toggling 'Enable WebGL' in chrome://flags.

  - Game audio is fairly unreliable and when it does play, it lags the gameplay quite significantly. Google are hard at work, implementing Web Audio for Chrome M27, so this is a temporary problem.

- Opera Mobile for Android

  - Works but performance is far behind Firefox and Chrome.

- BlackBerry 10 browser
- Firefox OS

  - If you don't have a test device, check out Mozilla's [Firefox OS Simulator](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/firefox-os-simulator-3-0-released/) that is delivered as a Firefox add-on.

Supported desktop browsers are:

- Firefox
- Chrome
- Internet Explorer (the game will request you install Chrome Frame if you do not already have it installed)

We'll be regularly updating the game in the coming weeks so give us your feedback. We'll also be releasing further blog entries detailing how we built the game. In the meantime, if you're interested in making your own HTML5 games with PlayCanvas, why not [join the beta](https://playcanvas.com/)?
