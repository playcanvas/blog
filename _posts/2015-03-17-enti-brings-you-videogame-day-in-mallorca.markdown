On 21st March, ENTI is holding VideoGame Day in Manacor on the beautiful Balearic island of Mallorca. It is their first workshop on videogame design and programming, where they are going to teach how to make robot dance using PlayCanvas! The workshop starts at 10AM and last for 4 hours.

The address:

Espai Na Camel•la, Manacor – Carrer d’en Tià de Sa Real s/n (see [here](https://goo.gl/maps/qGfvSnoBEysxqwEc9) for a map).

VideoGame Day is brought to you by two videogame experts. First, we have Josep Francesc Cortés Fullana from Manacor, who has been working in the field of video games for Kerad Games in Barcelona for many years. And there is Jordi Targa, the professor of the Upper Grade Educational Cycle in 3D, Games and Interactive Environments at ENTI, offering to the participants a course of programming and design of video games based on PlayCanvas!

The conference consists of two parts. The first part is the conference related to the video games world, constantly growing market, and the job opportunities it offers.

The second part is a practical course where the participants have an opportunity to create a video game online and thanks using PlayCanvas and also have a chance to win a powerful Chromebook-2 by entering our PlayHack event.

VideoGame Day is free of charge and welcomes everybody interested in videogame development.

You can apply for participation sending an e-mail to: <info@enti.cat> or confirm it personally in Education Department or Manacor Council (c/Muntaner 12)

It is recommended that all attendees bring a notebook for the practical part of the workshop.
