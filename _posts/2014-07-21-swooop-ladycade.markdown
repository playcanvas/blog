Last Friday night PlayCanvas resident artist [Philippa Moore](http://www.philippamoore.com/) took our game [SWOOOP](http://swooop.playcanvas.com/) up to Dalston to the [London Game Space](http://londongamespace.com/). The event?

[LadyCADE](http://ladycade.org/), a casual and friendly gathering for people who make and enjoy games... and who happen to be women.

A fantastic event which we were delighted to be able to attend. Look out for future LadyCade's at other events like Nottingham Game City later this year. Make sure you [follow them on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_LadyCADE) for more updates.

We held a make-shift high score competition with post-it notes on the wall and big congratulations to [@flappyfingers](http://twitter.com/flappyfingers) for his determination in taking away to the top spot.

The final results are here:

Thanks to Gemma, Holly and others who helped to organize this great event.
