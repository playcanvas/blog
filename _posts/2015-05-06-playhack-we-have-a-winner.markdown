PLAYHACK April ended last week and we've spent the weekend rolling balls and dodging platforms.

Many strong entries this month, but we chose our winner based on how they delivered the complete package. **Over 32 levels designed,** audio, user interface, a tutorial. And it becomes the second PLAYHACK game to make it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marbleous/jbcgphppffkahpoiobhfdjfpbapbjblh/related) .
