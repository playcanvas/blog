We've moved! Long live [playcanvas.com](https://playcanvas.com)

You may have noticed we've moved all of the old platform.playcanvas.com address over to the main domain of [https://playcanvas.com](https://playcanvas.com). This is long overdue and just down to how we initially set up the wordpress and main platform application at the start.

### Your Profile

What this means is that your PlayCanvas profile now has pride of place on our site. https://playcanvas.com/ is a place where people can find all your projects and published games. Hopefully you can use this as a base for your game development, maybe a history of what you've worked on and your proudest projects.

We'll be expanding on this profile page over the next few months, but if you have any suggestions and ideas for what **you** would like to see on this page, then please get in touch with us through one of our [community sites](https://playcanvas.com/community).

### More walkthroughs

You may also have noticed that we've started listing walkthroughs on your profile page. As part of our current effort to help you all get the most out of PlayCanvas we're updating the walkthroughs more, and we'll be adding some more in the near future. Again, [let us know](https://playcanvas.com/community) what you think of the existing ones and what you'd like to see in a future walkthrough.
