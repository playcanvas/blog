Yesterday, at PlayCanvas we hosted our first physical Game Jam. By physical, I mean we had all the developers in the same location, not that we made them run around and do push-ups!

Based out of the 80s sci-fi haven that is the Virgin Media Game Space, a group of 9 of us spent the day hacking on brand new games, modelling manga robots, and techno beats.

Yes, I know you wish you were there.

For us this is an excellent opportunity to see developers at work, using our tools together to prototype ideas and build stuff.

Your feedback is what makes PlayCanvas great.

Go check out users [roseninja](https://playcanvas.com/user/roseninja), [jellycakes](https://playcanvas.com/user/jellycakes), [wilbefast](https://playcanvas.com/user/wilbefast), [nebulousflynn](https://playcanvas.com/user/nebulousflynn) and [balkango](https://playcanvas.com/user/balkango) who were all building games yesterday. It's early days for [Flying robots of Death](https://playcanvas.com/project/1322/overview/test) and [Squeaky Wheel](https://playcanvas.com/project/1326/overview/blah), but terrific work for an afternoon of coding and modelling.

We've got more Game Jams coming up. Will is at [onGameStart](http://ongamestart.com) in Poland next week.

Here's a little vine of Flying robots of Death for those who don't have two GamePads to plug-in and play.
