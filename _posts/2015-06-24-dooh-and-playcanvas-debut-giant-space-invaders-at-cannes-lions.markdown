Dominating the sea-front is the Grand Cannes, a vast 18 meter wide LED screen that sits atop the Grand Hotel. [DOOH](http://dooh.com/), a world leader in Digital Out Of Home experiences, wanted to create a gaming experience people could play on that screen to wow the world of advertising.

"At DOOH, we're constantly devising new and refreshing ways to engage consumers as they go about their lives." said Andrew Newman, CEO of DOOH. "Gaming has a key role in that. So at Cannes Lions, we're enabling passers by to play the world's largest game of Space Invaders. And since everybody has a smartphone, everybody can play. Just visit a web link to load up the DOOHpad, our virtual controller. To build DOOH Invaders, we needed a partner who understands the intersection of gaming and advertising. The natural choice was PlayCanvas and they've built something truly special."
