On Friday, 18th November, PlayCanvas HQ was visited by BBC News, the world's largest broadcast news organization. Our CEO Will was interviewed live on the 6 o'clock evening news which has viewing figures of around 1 million people.

It was a great opportunity to promote London as a great place for young tech companies to do business. Will describes the benefits for finding great talent, but London has so much more to offer. Outside of the US, London has the most active venture capital scene. Most international companies chose to locate an office in London. Transport links are superb. Government tax breaks are in place to assist tech startups, particularly in the gaming space. And on top of that, it's an incredible place to live.

We can't imagine being anywhere else!
