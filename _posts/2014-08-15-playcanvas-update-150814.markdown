**This week, PlayCanvas travelled far and wide to attend the world's biggest games and graphics conferences.**

### GDC Europe, gamescom and SIGGRAPH

Will (PlayCanvas CEO) headed off to [GDC Europe](http://www.gdceurope.com/) and [gamescom](https://www.gamescom.global/)this week while Dave (PlayCanvas CTO) traveled to Vancouver for SIGGRAPH. PlayCanvas made a real splash at both and in the next few days, we'll be writing a blog entry dedicated to each trip.

### Features and Fixes:

- We improved the rendering of the PlayCanvas website at mobile resolutions. Explore the site on your smartphone to see how great the site looks now.
- Kevin, our Design Guru, has refreshed the design on various 'logged in' pages, making navigation clearer and simpler.
