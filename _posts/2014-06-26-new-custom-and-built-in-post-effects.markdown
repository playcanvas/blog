**Built-in Post Effects**

The visual element of gaming experiences is as important as any other and we want the projects made by our [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com) community to look as good as they can. Adding to our already extensive [library of Post Effects](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/tree/master/extras/posteffects), we have spoiled you lucky PlayCanvas users as you can now choose from effects such as Bloom, Brightness-Contrast, Hue-Saturation, FXAA, Sepia and Vignette with a simple right click on the camera entity in the hierarchy. Its as easy as that! Thanks to PlayCanvas you don't have to be an artist to make your games look cool. Want to find out more about the new built-in post effects? Cast your eyes [here](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/posteffects/).

**Custom Post Effects**

We count ourselves lucky to work with very creative PlayCanvas users and many members have an incredible eye for detail. If you know some JavaScript and GLSL then you can create your own Post Effects, using our [step by step guide](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/advanced/custom-posteffect/) on writing the script for your effect/s and a library of [existing Post Effects](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/tree/master/extras/posteffects) for reference you can really bring your entities to life (well almost).

Now we have given you the tools, its time for you to take your project to the next level. Modify your entities and give your game a truly stunning atmosphere.
