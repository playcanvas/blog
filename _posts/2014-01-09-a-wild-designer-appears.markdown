To kick off 2014 with a bang, we're welcoming a brand new member to the PlayCanvas family.

<br>_Kevin's image doesn't appear on film, so we've used this instead._

Kevin Rooney joins us as Creative Director, check out his [amazing portfolio](https://roonio.com/). Kevin is an experienced designer who has sampled the start-up life before at [Memrise](http://memrise.com).

What does this mean? Kevin brings a much needed designer's touch to the PlayCanvas team, so look out for big changes to the look and feel of the PlayCanvas site in the coming weeks. Currently we have a kick-ass tool for creating HTML5 and WebGL games in the browser, but very soon we're going to have a beautiful one as well.

Welcome Kevin on his [twitter](https://twitter.com/4roonio).
