Time for an update from the PlayCanvas development team! Throughout March, you may have noticed some updates to the PlayCanvas Editor. In case, you've missed any of them, here's a run down of what's new:

### Hierarchy Improvements

Nestled at  the top of the hierarchy panel is the new 'Fuzzy Search' box. If you're creating ever bigger projects, it used to be hard to track down specific entities. But now, with the new search functionality, it's a breeze. Even if you mistype your search term, the Editor will return results which closely match it.

We've had a few requests for SHIFT-select of entities and also multi-selection reparenting. So both of these are now possible! We're so good to you!

### Orthographic Editor Cameras

More and more of you are making 2D games or games that are played out in a 2D arena. As a result, we've overhauled the Editor's orthographic cameras to be far more useable. Camera controls are more intuitive and the gizmos now work as expected.

### Miscellaneous Improvements

- The profiler has a host of new stats on display to help you tune the performance of your application.
- 32 and 64 pixel resolutions have been added for shadowmaps.
- The 'L' hotkey has been added to switch between world and local gizmo space.
- Multi-user editing of document type assets has been improved (HTML/CSS/JSON/Text).

That it for now, but keep on the look out for our next feature update announcement, coming by the end of the week. It's going to be a big one!
