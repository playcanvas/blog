**Welcome PlayCanvas fans, tea and coffee spillages have menaced the office this week, but still we carry on, here are the updates for this week:**

## Features and Fixes

- **New Gizmos** for you to play with. We've enhanced the Designer gizmo controls. See the screenshots and descriptions below.
- Fixed a small error when adding a script to a folder.
- Exporting your Packs has received a performance boost - it's now even quicker to show the world the results of your hard work.

## Updated Gizmos

_Translation Gizmo: now you can move any selected in 2 dimensions at the same time by clicking on the planes in between the two axes you wish to translate the object over. Also the view of the planes react to your viewpoint - if you look at the model along the x axis you will only see the y-z plane._

_Scaling Gizmo: a new uniform scale control has been added - access by clicking the new white block and drag the mouse to scale in all directions._

## UKIE Games Expo 

Earlier this week, our esteemed CEO Will Eastcott felt like showing some people the future of web-based gaming and so headed off to the **Liverpool International Festival for Business** and [their games development showcase](https://www.events.ukti.gov.uk/creative-business-breakfast-and-uk-games-industry-showcase--ifb) to demonstrate the PlayCanvas platform.

## SWOOOP
