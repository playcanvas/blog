Over the last few months, we have been working on an [Editor API](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/designer/editor-api/) that allows users to automate tedious tasks and extend the base functionality.

We are excited to announce the beta release of the API today and would love to see how the PlayCanvas community will use it to power up their workflows!

Creating and modifying Entities and Assets are all accessible via the API. Add/remove components, scripts, tags, assets, create and instantiate templates and so much more.

Here's a great example where a context menu can be added to select Entity parents in the hierarchy to speed up scene editing:

Or add random Entities to the scene:

More examples and links to the documentation can be found in the [User Manual](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/designer/editor-api/).

## Join our Open Source Effort

The PlayCanvas team is a big advocate for open source. This is why we have taken the step to open source the Editor API on [GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/editor-api). We want to build the best possible API for you so we need your help:

- Log issues and features requests (or leave feedback on those submitted by others).
- Submit pull requests for fixes and API changes.
- Watch the repo or individual issues to get progress updates in real time.

Get experimenting and show us your work with the Editor API in the [forums](https://forum.playcanvas.com/)!
