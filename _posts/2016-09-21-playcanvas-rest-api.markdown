![REST API](/assets/media/rest-api.png)

Today we're launching the first version of the PlayCanvas REST API.

The REST API is available to all Organization account holders and allows developers to automate processes to help them with their development. For example, you can use the API to create a daily build of your application and download it via a build server. In the future we'll be expanding the API with additional features like access to assets and more.

You can read more details about the API in the [documentation](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/api/).

We'd love to hear your thoughts on how you are using the API and what you'd like to see in the future. Let us know on our [forum](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/playcanvas-rest-api/2498).
