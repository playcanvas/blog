Submit a game to Ludum Dare and get a 1 year pro account for **free**!

At PlayCanvas we love to Jam. Specifically, we love to Game Jam. And of all the Game Jams, the one we love the most is the "build a game in a weekend with nothing more than your wits" Jam called [Ludum Dare](https://ludumdare.com/).

To celebrate Ludum Dare #28 we've launched [a deal](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/12/08/ludum-deals-for-ld28/). If you submit a game to the Ludum Dare competition (Solo or Jam) using PlayCanvas this weekend you'll get a 1 year pro account **for free**. That's an amazing $180 of game development goodness for you right there.

All you need to do to claim your prize is email <support@playcanvas.com> with your PlayCanvas username and a link to you game page on the Ludum Dare site.

Happy Jamming
