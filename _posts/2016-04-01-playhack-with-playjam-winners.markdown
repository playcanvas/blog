It's finally over. The games were completed a few weeks ago and 6 judges have toiled over the games and struggled to grade and rate them. But we have a decision and boy it was close...

Over the course of 6 weeks, over 150 teams forked our original project and worked their little gamedev butts off to finish the games in time. In the end we had over 30 playable entries - more than enough to keep our judges busy.

### **[Orbital Survival](https://playcanv.as/p/3G3RnfUz)**

Congratulations to [el-pepi](https://playcanvas.com/el-pepi) who takes the grand prize with this fast paced orbital shooter. Defend your tiny moon from incoming UFOs and slimy blobs using only the upgradable gun on your robot arm. There's nothing more terrifying than seeing a rogue 5-shot-burst looping over the horizon back towards you. Our judges said: _"Simple but fun and keeps you coming back for more"_

## Second Place - £1000
