If you've been following the tech news over the last few months you'll have noticed that Apple is about to launch the latest version of their mobile operating system iOS 8. For us game developers this is awesome news because iOS 8 supports WebGL in mobile Safari (the [news we broke on this blog](https://blog.playcanvas.com/apple-embraces-webgl/) a few months ago).

It's not just browser support for PlayCanvas games we're interested in though. We also want to make sure you can get your PlayCanvas into the App Store. So, in advance of the iOS 8 release, we're really pleased to be launching a new feature today for our Pro users.

### PlayCanvas iOS Export

It's now dead simple to get your PlayCanvas game running as a native iOS application. Take a look at our little video introduction.

It's just one click to get a XCode project which is easy to build into a iPhone application.

### Web vs Native

PlayCanvas is designed to use all the best features of the web, online collaboration, accessible from every device and shareable links. But that doesn't mean we don't see the advantages of native applications, especially on mobile. Installed games are run offline and can be easier to monetize.

You can now get the best of both worlds by releasing your games on the web and on iOS. Use the web to build viral, shareable games and release the same game on iOS, where the audience is ready to monetize.

### Give it a try

If you're a Pro account holder, you'll see the iOS download right now in your exports tab. Get yourself a copy of the XCode 6 GM from the Apple Developer site and try it out. If you're not a Pro account holder, what are you waiting for? Get yourself [upgraded](https://playcanvas.com/account) right now! ;-)
