PlayCanvas has now completed the 3 month long TechStars programme and to mark the occasion, a glitzy Demo Day was held at an exclusive theatre in London's Victoria.

Will took to the stage (to the sound of Gangnam Style!) to present the technology to a 350 strong audience of angel investors, venture capitalists and the press.

The feedback has been incredible! After the pitch, the PlayCanvas demo booth was bustling with people hungry to know more about our plans to shake up the games industry.




We were also incredibly flattered by the reaction from the technology press. First up, we have TechCrunch:
