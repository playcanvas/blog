A video tutorial recreating arcade classic, Lunar Lander in 3D.

This is our second video tutorial. It's a bit longer (around 45mins) but it covers a lot of stuff. Uploading 3D models, physics coding, collision events, input controllers, playing audio and publishing games to the web. It's a great introduction to lots of major features of PlayCanvas.
