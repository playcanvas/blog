On May 13th, San Francisco played host to 3D Web Fest.

The event was designed to showcase websites that represent the best of the best of the 3D Web. The content on show - presented as Live Performance Art – was amazing, delightful, surprising and at times disturbing. There were creations by artists and developers of all kinds showing off their best 3D web sites live with musical accompaniment. The running order was as follows:

The man behind the controls was Brad Grantham of ARM. He selected some superb music to accompany the visuals. Check 'Hush' out [here](http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1400004). Kudos to Brad for doing an incredible job!

It's very exciting to see WebGL content being recognized as an artform and even more exciting to see PlayCanvas content representing the best of the web. We're looking forward to a follow up event at some point in the future!
