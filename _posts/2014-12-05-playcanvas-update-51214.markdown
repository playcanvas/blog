**Its been a year full of huge announcements for us and the first iteration our Asset Store is certainly no small matter. From the PlayCanvas Store to a Ludum Dare deal (and everything in between), here's what has happened at PlayCanvas over the past week.**

### PlayCanvas Store

Today we **launched** the **Beta version of the PlayCanvas Store!** While the current version only has around 40 3D models in total, as the PlayCanvas Store grows we should hope to see thousands of **game ready assets** become available to our community. **Try the beta for free at [https://store.playcanvas.com/](https://store.playcanvas.com/).**

**This preview version of the store features assets from 4 of our great partners:**

- [http://www.propsplanet.com/](http://www.propsplanet.com/)
- [http://gamedevmarket.net/](http://gamedevmarket.net/)
- [https://www.cgtrader.com/](https://www.cgtrader.com/)
- [https://3dmodels-textures.com/](https://3dmodels-textures.com/)

Soon we'll be giving all of our PlayCanvas users the chance to become vendors, opening up their assets to over 20,000 PlayCanvas game developers. If you're interested in becoming a vendor for the PlayCanvas store, please get in touch: <sales@playcanvas.com>.

### Features

#### Cubemap Textures

We now support cubemap assets. In turn have also deployed a **cubemap editor** which allows you to create cubemaps by assigning 6 images to each slot of the cube. To **make your materials appear reflective** you can reference a cubemap, then the material will reflect the sides of the cube (pending that you assign a cubemap to the Reflection section of a material).

#### Skybox Scene Setting

We also support Scene Skyboxes. Before if you wanted to make a skybox you needed an Entity with a skybox component, but now you can **create a cubemap** and then **assign that cubemap to the skybox slot** in the Scene Settings.

#### Material Upgrades

We've deployed more and more interesting features to the material editor. Look out for more big things happening here.

#### Particles

Our particle system beta is moving forwards. We're getting close to releasing this for everyone. [Get in touch](mailto:info@playcanvas.com?subject=Particle%20System%20Beta) if you'd like to try it out early.

### Community

#### PLAYHACK December

We are 4 days in to our 2nd game jam and this month you talented developers have a pretty appropriate model to play with. We've given you Santa and one of his 'normal nosed' reindeer to keep you company this December. **Find out everything you need to know [here](https://blog.playcanvas.com/playhack-december-jolly-santa/)**.

#### Ludum Dare 31 - DEAL

If a month seems like too long to make a game. **This weekend is Ludum Dare 31**, a 48 hour game making competition. It's a great way to get a feel for the full process of imagining, designing, building and then shipping a game.

We're running a **special deal** this weekend. If you enter Ludum Dare and complete a game using PlayCanvas we'll give you a **FREE PRO 15** account for a full year. Can't say fairer than that! See the [Ludum Deals](https://ludumdare.com//2014/11/01/ludum-deals-for-ld31/) page for more details.
