<div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERnS5agXBkk" title="Voxelo.ai - AI-Powered 3DGS Product Visualization" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, we are excited to be joined by Vladimir, Roman and Ben from <a href="https://voxelo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Voxelo</a> as they celebrate the beta release of <a href="https://voxelo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Voxelo.ai</a> 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to our Developer Spotlight! Tell us a bit about yourselves.</strong></p>
<p><em>Vlad</em>: We’re the team behind a new solution - <a href="https://voxelo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><strong>Voxelo.ai</strong></a> - an ambitious group of engineers and product builders with backgrounds spanning 3D, AI, e-commerce and marketing. We’ve spent years working across web-based 3D, product visualization, and content production, and Voxelo.ai grew out of a shared frustration: e-commerce product experiences haven’t evolved nearly enough, and traditional 3D production is still too slow, expensive, and specialist-heavy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Voxelo Team" src="https://blog.playcanvas.com/assets/images/voxelo-team-6b5aa12f7a7be82c0c1ca42682a3585e.png" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"><br>
<em>Left to right: Ben McKay, COO (ex-WPP agency and product leader); Vladimir Mulhem, CEO (ex-founder of 3D agency Creative Content Works); Roman Bromidge, CTO (ex-founder of Kaedim, a 3D AI start-up)</em></p>
<p><strong>How did you first discover PlayCanvas?</strong></p>
<p><em>Roman</em>: PlayCanvas kept coming up whenever we looked at high-performance, production-grade 3D viewers. As soon as we started testing real-time viewers for high-fidelity 3D assets, it became clear that PlayCanvas was setting the benchmark for performance and advanced features.</p>
<p><em>Vlad</em>: It wasn’t just about the technical merits of the platform today. Having met with Will Eastcott a few times, we were excited by the alignment in ambition and direction. That kind of shared mindset really matters when choosing long-term partners.</p>
<p><strong>What made you choose PlayCanvas instead of other web technologies?</strong></p>
<p><em>Ben</em>: Customers are king. That’s always the starting point. Our customers are e-commerce businesses where CX and web performance directly impact sales, so we have to maximize visual fidelity without compromising performance. Anything less than industry-leading simply isn’t good enough.</p>
<p><em>Roman</em>: We tested plenty of alternatives, but PlayCanvas consistently delivered better frame rates, lower memory usage, and a more robust engine-level architecture. For a commercial platform like <a href="https://voxelo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Voxelo.ai</a>, that reliability is critical. Add to that its open-source nature and flexibility - it fits perfectly with our ambitious roadmap and avoids locking us into rigid development models.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s talk about Voxelo.ai. In your own words, what is Voxelo.ai and what problem does it solve?</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Voxelo Platform" src="https://blog.playcanvas.com/assets/images/voxelo-platform-19c01900acedb337517f2f2dfd19a114.png" width="2048" height="1173" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>Ben</em>: <a href="https://voxelo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Voxelo.ai</a> is building a new type of AI content studio, with 3D at its heart. Our goal is to close the buyer confidence gap by bringing people closer to a product’s features and benefits through better product content.</p>
<p>We start by turning simple product videos and images into ultra-realistic 3D digital twins - optimised Gaussian splats. We listened closely to e-commerce businesses and designed a user-generated 3D workflow that lets them access the benefits of 3D without expensive equipment, specialist skills, long timelines, or big budgets. That’s a huge unlock for e-commerce. We refer to it as <a href="https://www.voxelo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">UG3D®</a> to underline the accessibility of this new format.</p>
<p>This serves two major needs.</p>
<p>First, consumers consistently say they want 3D because it increases confidence when buying - which means businesses increasingly <em>need</em> 3D. We make that accessible.</p>
<p>Second, it’s about operational efficiency. Once you have a 3D digital twin, almost anything becomes possible in product content - and that’s what we’re rolling out now.</p>
<p>With a digital twin, customers can create interactive 3D models, AR experiences, lifestyle imagery, and on-brand product visuals - all within an end-to-end platform. With PlayCanvas’ help, Voxelo delivers this at high impact, high speed, and low cost.</p>
<p><strong>3D and AI-driven 3D is evolving fast - what excites you most about this space?</strong></p>
<p><em>Roman</em>: The shift from handcrafted 3D to data-driven 3D is huge. AI makes it possible to generate rich spatial content from everyday inputs like video. That fundamentally changes who can create 3D, and how often it can evolve.</p>
<p><em>Vlad</em>: There’s a real 3D wave coming. It’s been building for years, but falling compute costs and better infrastructure mean businesses can finally deliver truly immersive shopping experiences at scale. Voxelo is right at the forefront of this. With support from Innovate UK, we’re investing heavily in R&amp;D to make 3D’s value accessible to far more people.</p>
<p><strong>How does Voxelo.ai make 3D content more accessible for non-technical users?</strong></p>
<p><em>Ben</em>: We obsess over workflow simplicity. Users don’t need to understand meshes, textures, or rendering pipelines. They upload a 3–4 minute video, Voxelo processes it, and they get a web-ready 3D + AR experience straight out of the box.</p>
<p>Creation, processing, and publishing are all just a few clicks. We want solo entrepreneurs wearing multiple hats to feel just as comfortable as global retailers.</p>
<p><strong>Could you walk us through the process of creating a 3D asset with Voxelo.ai?</strong></p>
<p><em>Roman</em>: The pipeline is intentionally simple:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Shoot a 3–4 minute product video (most people use mobile phones, but DSLRs are great too)</li>
<li class="">Upload it to <a href="https://voxelo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Voxelo.ai</a></li>
<li class="">Publish your product in 3D and AR</li>
</ul>
<p>More advanced AI features are on the way. From there, we can also generate classic e-commerce imagery and lifestyle shots, all powered by the same 3D digital twin.</p>
<p><strong>Can you give an example of how Voxelo.ai is being used effectively today?</strong></p>
<p><em>Ben</em>: We’re seeing strong traction in e-commerce product visualization, especially in categories where detail and realism matter—fashion, footwear, furniture, and homeware.</p>
<p>Early customers include major brands and retailers like Cosatto and SportShoes.com that are looking for scalability without compromising on the quality.</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://app.voxelo.ai/viewer/md7aja12f2x9csfkjkdamc1sdh7z6cv2" title="Voxelo.ai 3D Product Viewer" allow="fullscreen; xr-spatial-tracking"></iframe></div>
<p>We see the greatest need, though, with mid-sized companies who are looking for a customer experience edge but haven’t had the budgets for costly 3D production previously. These have included emerging fashion designers like BEPO, who turn military parachutes into designer clothing, or Recondition, who make jeans for people with mobility challenges. Or manufacturers, like Eden Play, who need help showcasing the quality of their hand-crafted playground equipment. Each has a story to tell and 3D can help.</p>
<p>And the applications keep expanding. From cars to cushions, pottery to plants, sofas to shoes - when cost, complexity, and time drop this much, 3D is no longer reserved for only big-ticket items.</p>
<p><strong>How did PlayCanvas help you deliver a smooth experience across desktop and mobile?</strong></p>
<p><em>Roman</em>: PlayCanvas gives us a consistent rendering layer across devices. The same asset works smoothly on desktop and mobile, with intelligent handling of performance constraints. That consistency is absolutely crucial for e-commerce customers.</p>
<p><strong>Were there any technical challenges integrating PlayCanvas, and how did you overcome them?</strong></p>
<p><em>Roman</em>: The main challenge was integrating PlayCanvas effectively into our React application while still extracting maximum performance. The biggest surprise was how, once we embraced PlayCanvas as a web-based game engine, many of our integration hurdles dissolved. Initially, we started with PlayCanvas React for rapid prototyping, which was great for verifying our concepts. However, we sometimes struggled with mapping specific functionalities not directly exposed by the wrapper, requiring us to write custom scripts to interface with the underlying engine systems.</p>
<p>For some of the more involved functionalities, like our AR viewer and splat editor, we found building them as native PlayCanvas applications and then linking or embedding them within our existing React app significantly improved both performance and development speed. This approach helped us minimize dependencies and side effects, allowing us to get the most out of the engine.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share any interesting performance optimizations you’ve implemented?</strong></p>
<p><em>Roman</em>: The greatest satisfaction came from the enormous performance gains we achieved over our previous 3D viewer implementation. We more than doubled the frame rate, and by leveraging PlayCanvas' <a class="" href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-open-sources-sog-format-for-gaussian-splatting">SOG format</a>, our 3D files are now a third of the size of our already compressed previous format. We've seen a 95%+ reduction in file size for the SOG file versus the raw PLY output from our 3D AI reconstruction process. It's amazing how a few simple, often overlooked things can dramatically improve performance; it just goes to show that thoroughly reading the documentation is always worthwhile. For instance, turning off anti-aliasing for our PlayCanvas app significantly boosts performance when rendering Gaussian splats—one little flag made a huge difference!</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://app.voxelo.ai/viewer/md7fq8htbf3j32vvan94xv36p17vr4vn" title="Voxelo.ai 3D Product Viewer" allow="fullscreen; xr-spatial-tracking"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Voxelo.ai has recently launched - how has the feedback been so far?</strong></p>
<p><em>Ben</em>: The feedback has been really encouraging. We’ve been open and transparent with users from day one, building <em>with</em> them rather than just <em>for</em> them. That partnership approach has been invaluable - it’s helped us effectively map out the next three years of product features and value (on top of plenty of ideas we already had ourselves).</p>
<p>Some of the early feedback has been usability-focused - things like making the capture process more intuitive, or improving guidance and help resources. But the most exciting feedback has been around our direction and ambition: users are asking for even more features, recognizing the recent performance gains (especially since deploying PlayCanvas), and calling out the jump in visual fidelity - in many cases comparable to high-quality e-commerce product photography.</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://app.voxelo.ai/viewer/md74wqcrsvfmp5055jthr3dy397xgkjq" title="Voxelo.ai 3D Product Viewer" allow="fullscreen; xr-spatial-tracking"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Who do you see as the ideal audience or customer for Voxelo.ai?</strong></p>
<p><em>Ben</em>: Our initial hypothesis was that SME retailers - particularly in footwear, fashion, furniture, and homeware - would benefit most from <a href="https://voxelo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Voxelo.ai</a>. That’s still very much true. But the biggest surprise has been the level of enterprise interest.</p>
<p>Large brands are wrestling with the same questions: <em>How do we create gold-standard PDPs (product detail pages)?</em> <em>How do we elevate our product experience and give us a competitive edge?</em></p>
<p>We’re building a new type of AI content studio powered by 3D - but designed to be genuinely easy to use and ready to scale across existing and emerging AI-powered workflows.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans for upcoming features or improvements?</strong></p>
<p><em>Roman</em>: Tons! More to come, but as a teaser - yes, we’re leaning hard into AI (I mean, who isn’t?). The goal is to make the product as easy and scalable as possible. We're rolling out a wave of new features in Q1, and a key focus will be refining and streamlining the onboarding experience - it’s a critical area we don’t want to overlook.</p>
<p>More broadly, we're optimizing to become ultra-native to e-commerce teams - embedding more deeply into their workflows, tools, and day-to-day operations.</p>
<p><em>Vlad</em>: Thanks in part to support from Innovate UK and our partnership with the University of Manchester, we’ve built a strong R&amp;D pipeline. Some aspects of the roadmap are still exploratory, but we’re not flying blind - we’re backing our ideas with a strong team and grounded market insight. A big theme is reducing the inputs required to create 3D while expanding what customers can do creatively, especially with AI. There’s a lot of potential here, and we’re excited for both the team and our users to push into these next frontiers.</p>
<p><strong>How can the PlayCanvas community try Voxelo.ai or get involved?</strong></p>
<p><em>Ben</em>: We’re actively onboarding early users and collaborators. The PlayCanvas community is ace, and we’re always keen to hear feedback from developers building real-world 3D products.</p>
<p>Whilst we’re building for non-technical users, we’re also hearing that technical specialists might well value simplified workflow. If any of the community want to create an account or partner in some way, <a href="https://v2.voxelo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">please register here</a> or email the team at <a href="mailto:hello@voxelo.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">hello@voxelo.ai</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see web-based photorealistic 3D content heading in the next few years?</strong></p>
<p><em>Vlad</em>: We believe 3D will become <strong>as standard as images and video</strong>, especially in commerce. AI will continue to reduce costs and friction, while engines like PlayCanvas make delivery seamless across devices.</p>
<p><em>Roman</em>: In the future, I believe it will become standard to have a 3D digital twin of your products, available at any time for you to leverage to make new content and help understand your buyers. No more messy management of ten different content pipelines, no more figuring out which warehouse your stock is in so you can ship it to the photographer, no more lost sales because you couldn't quite realize your vision for how the product can be shown. Furthermore, with embedded 3D on your product page, you can understand your customer better than ever before: what exactly do customers look at on your product before they click buy? What do they spend the most time examining? With <a href="https://voxelo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Voxelo.ai</a>, we're really excited because having a realistic 3D representation of your product enables so many more opportunities to improve buyer confidence and gain deeper understanding of your customers.</p>
<p><em>Ben</em>: I hope to see it across all web platforms...at least in the context of social commerce. It feels odd that the technology now exists, consumers want it and businesses need it. It has the potential to increase consumers' product comprehension, increase growth and reduce returns (and with it, reduce carbon footprint)...and yet. Surely, it’s just around the corner. Surely.</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for developers looking to build commercial products on PlayCanvas?</strong></p>
<p><em>Roman</em>: Build with real users early. PlayCanvas is incredibly capable, but the biggest wins come from pairing strong performance with simple, opinionated, constructive and collaborative user experiences. Don't be afraid to ask questions, read the docs thoroughly, and think of it more like a game engine than a traditional web dependency.</p>
<p><strong>What’s been the most rewarding part of building Voxelo.ai so far?</strong></p>
<p><em>Vlad</em>: I’ve spent the vast majority of my career obsessed with 3D, because in e-commerce the limitations of a flat, 2D screen are felt more acutely than anywhere else. We ask customers to make purchase decisions without touch, weight, scale, or presence - and then wonder why confidence drops and returns go up.</p>
<p>Turning a 2D screen into a 3D experience fundamentally changes that equation. 3D allows products to be explored rather than imagined. It gives shoppers clarity around form, proportion, detail, and quality - the same cues they rely on in the physical world. When done well, 3D doesn’t just look impressive; it reduces uncertainty, builds trust, and helps people buy with confidence.</p>
<p>What excites me most today is that 3D is finally becoming viable at e-commerce scale. Historically, it’s been too expensive, too slow, and too specialist-driven to deploy across large catalogues. With real-time web engines and AI-driven 3D creation, we’re reaching an inflection point where 3D can be produced as naturally as images or video.</p>
<p>That shift unlocks a future where 3D isn’t a novelty or a campaign asset, but a core layer of product content - helping every shopper better understand what they’re buying, and helping brands convert more confidently at scale.</p>
<p><em>Roman</em>: The most rewarding part has been building all the exciting ways for users to leverage their 3D digital twin. From my background as co-founder of Kaedim, I understood that 3D is critical for so many industries, yet so underutilized because of its cost and difficulty. Now, I'm really excited to enable new generations of creatives to transform their products into 3D and from there into anything they can imagine.</p>
<p><em>Ben</em>: Just to add…seeing users create compelling 3D experiences without needing to become 3D experts. That moment when something complex suddenly feels easy is exactly why we built <a href="https://voxelo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Voxelo.ai</a>…and will continue to build in a way that grows buyer confidence.</p>
<p><strong>What’s one message you want to leave with our readers?</strong></p>
<p><em>Ben</em>: 3D has tried to break through before - but this time, it feels a little different. The tech is ready, costs are dropping dramatically and growing numbers of communities are rallying. And now, AI has blown the doors open on creative potential. Interactive, ultra-real 3D and AI is no longer coming - it’s here - and Voxelo is all in on re-imagining how this impacts new digital experiences. Huge thanks to the community for the support!</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for chatting with us, Vlad, Roman and Ben!</strong></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Goodbye SOGS. Hello SOG! 👋</p>
<p>Back in May, <a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-adopts-sogs-for-20x-3dgs-compression" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">PlayCanvas announced support for SOGS</a>, a revolutionary super-compressed format for 3D Gaussian splats. While SOGS was a huge leap beyond other compression techniques, we were still not satisfied! So we set about designing a new and improved iteration of the format.</p>
<p>Today, we are proud to introduce <strong>SOG: Spatially Ordered Gaussians</strong>.</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe id="viewer" width="800" height="500" allow="fullscreen; xr-spatial-tracking" src="https://superspl.at/s?id=964b09c1"></iframe></div>
<p><em>The Skate Park above is not a video!</em> Navigate around the scene and explore! The splat was scanned by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christoph-schindelar-79515351/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Christoph Schindelar</a>. It has 4 million Gaussians but is compressed to a mere 42MB with SOG. The original PLY was 1GB, meaning a <strong>~95% reduction</strong> in file size.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-is-sog">What is SOG<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-open-sources-sog-format-for-gaussian-splatting#what-is-sog" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is SOG" title="Direct link to What is SOG" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>SOG shares a great deal in common with its predecessor. It is still a <code>meta.json</code> file that references multiple <code>.webp</code> images. So what's new and why is it better?</p>
<p>📦 <strong>More convenient:</strong> Your SOG splats can now also be written to a single <code>.sog</code> file<br>
<!-- -->⚡ <strong>Faster to load:</strong> SOG stores splat data in Morton order meaning it's 'GPU-ready' and doesn't require processing on load<br>
<!-- -->🗜️ <strong>Easier to compress:</strong> SOGS compression required CUDA but SOG only needs WebGPU so it runs anywhere<br>
<!-- -->🎯 <strong>More precision:</strong> SOG minimizes compression artifacts by making smarter use of the same number of bits</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the fifth edition of Developer Spotlight, a series of blog articles where we talk to developers about how they use PlayCanvas and showcase the fantastic work they are doing on the web.</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBNza9uwiXo" title="Reflct is Live: 20× Smaller Files, 2× FPS, Shopify Support - A better 3DGS viewer." allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, we are excited to be joined by In Ha and Willie from <a href="https://reflct.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Reflct</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to our Developer Spotlight! Tell us a bit about yourselves.</strong></p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: I'm Willie, I co-founded Reflct with In Ha. I’ve been working in and around 3D and web development since my University days, where I dropped out to try my hand at a game development startup. It failed, but I learned a lot and developed a fixation with interactive tech. That first experience is what really drove my career, afterwards I worked for a few years in VR, and then into creative web and product development. I’m more of a creative technologist type, In Ha is the sole developer of the main Reflct application. I just work on our side things, like <a href="https://sharp-frames.reflct.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Sharp Frames</a>, and handle the 3DGS production side for our direct clients.</p>
<p><em>In Ha</em>: I'm In Ha, I studied computer graphics and have spent my career so far in web 3D and front-end development. I am a huge enthusiast of 3D graphics and rendering technologies on the web.</p>
<p><strong>How did you first discover PlayCanvas?</strong></p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: It was through the 3DGS community, PlayCanvas really is the biggest name in the space, and you can’t be into 3DGS without hearing about PlayCanvas at some point.</p>
<p><em>In Ha</em>: Yeah, that's about right. When I was quite new to 3DGS, Willie showed me there was a tool to modify the splats, and it worked very well. It was SuperSplat by PlayCanvas. It was the very first tool I heard of when I entered the realm of 3DGS.</p>
<p><strong>What made you choose PlayCanvas for Reflct instead of other web technologies?</strong></p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: Well, we didn't at first. We were using Mark Kellogg’s three.js plugin for a long time. We made that decision early on when his project was the only one that had second-degree spherical harmonics. Over time, though, we saw what the PlayCanvas team was doing and ultimately made the decision to switch over. It’s open source, reliable, performant, and just really, really good. You guys are doing great work — I wish we had made the shift sooner.</p>
<p><em>In Ha</em>: It's fast and simple to use.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s talk about Reflct. In your own words, what is Reflct and what problem does it solve?</strong></p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: We built Reflct to enable commercial use cases for 3DGS assets. 3DGS is this amazing technology; photorealistic 3D at real-time frame rates in the browser. It’s as mind-blowing to me now as it was when the Inria paper first dropped. But most ‘normal’ people don’t know how to navigate a 3D space in the browser, particularly on mobile, and you can really get lost in a 3DGS scene. We let creators control what a user sees in their scene by setting specific viewpoints, with orbit limits that control how much the user is able to move around. Each viewpoint can carry metadata which can be used for commerce integrations or custom features. Rich tools and features for creators, with a super simple viewer that non-technical people can navigate.</p>
<p><em>In Ha</em>: It is also important to mention that we provide tools to help users implement their 3DGS assets on their websites, with the same navigation configured in our dashboard. This makes the whole integration process a lot easier. Our React library is one, and our Shopify component is another. We aim to keep expanding those tools to increase coverage.</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe id="viewer" width="800" height="500" allow="fullscreen; xr-spatial-tracking" src="https://www.reflct.app/embed/ZW1iZWQ6OWQ2MmM0MjAtNTUzOS00ZGQxLWE2ZjQtMzNiZmMwZmU1MWMyOjdoVWM0MVB0elVQa0R1Q3pKbW0zbWQ="></iframe></div>
<p><strong>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is still a new technology — what excites you most about it?</strong></p>
<p><em>In Ha</em>: When I first heard what it is and saw some examples of it, it seemed to me that the way splats work resembles the idea of “pixels” on the screen. In this case, they are pixels in 3D, not 2D. Each splat in 3D space has color and other attributes, just like 2D pixels, which have coordinates and color.</p>
<p>I was amazed by the idea and concept behind the technique. I am very excited about what people could do with 3DGS in the future.</p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: I'm excited for the future of the technology. There are a lot of smart people around the world pushing the boundaries, making it smaller, faster, more realistic. SOGs are a good example. And it’s so new, we’re only a couple of years in.</p>
<p><strong>How does Reflct make navigating and exploring 3DGS content easier for non-technical users?</strong></p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: We just make it simple. We wanted something that we could give to our parents and they’d be able to figure out how it works. There are three big buttons at the bottom: left and right arrows, and a play button. If you drag the screen, the camera orbits a single point. No WASD, no free-roaming movement. Easy, but behind the scenes the creator has a bunch of features to help curate the experience for users.</p>
<p>The creator can manage ‘views’ in the Reflct dashboard. These are coordinates to which we move the camera when the user presses one of the arrow buttons. Each view has some data attached to it: position and focal point, as well as orbit limits, zoom, transition animation details, and product metadata. The orbit limits are important since they give the creator control over the movement of the camera, which means they can direct the user’s attention to the best parts of the scene without letting them see the ‘rough edges’ you get in 3DGS.</p>
<p>All these little bits add up to a powerful feature set for curating the experience of navigating the 3DGS space, but all the end user sees is three buttons.</p>
<p><strong>Could you walk us through the process of curating a scene in the Reflct dashboard?</strong></p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: Sure, when you drag in your <code>.ply</code> we’ll automatically compress it, then you just move around like you would in any 3D viewer. Once you find a viewpoint you like, you click ‘Add view’. You can edit the details for that view, set the orbit limits, change the focal point, configure the transition animations. There are also features to add hotspots or annotations.</p>
<p>You just do that a few times to set all the points in your scene where you want to direct the user's attention. Then you create a shareable link, or integrate it with your site using our React library or Shopify app. If you’re using our Shopify app, you can add the <code>productHandle</code> to the view metadata and it will automatically pull the product details into the side panel.</p>
<p><strong>Orbit limits and managed views sound like powerful tools — can you give an example of how they’ve been used effectively?</strong></p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: The Shopify app is a good example. Brands can capture a showroom or a staged space with their products, then each product can have its own set of views. Setting the views gives the creator a way to guide the user through the space, and the orbit limits ensure that they only see the products from the best angles.</p>
<p>When this is integrated with Shopify, the end user is able to explore a ‘shoppable’ 3DGS environment. Each time they move to a new product, the product details are displayed in the application. It’s quite exciting - we haven’t seen that type of e-commerce experience before. We’re working with a few different brands here in New Zealand to take this to the next level.</p>
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" controls="" src="/img/developer-spotlight-reflct-shopify-app.mp4" style="width:100%;height:auto"></video>
<p><strong>Let’s dive into some technical details. How did PlayCanvas help you deliver a smooth experience across desktop and mobile?</strong></p>
<p><em>In Ha</em>: We were using the GaussianSplats3D viewer by mkkellogg before we made the switch. We decided on the viewer very early on in our journey; at the time, we felt it was the best choice. Over time, though, we saw the PlayCanvas team releasing amazing features while the support for the viewer we were using slowly faded away. When PlayCanvas released the SOGs demo, it was the last nail in the coffin and we started the refactor.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Reflct Memory Savings" src="https://blog.playcanvas.com/assets/images/developer-spotlight-reflct-memory-389491c6e7ce21498aa9bb16fe16e6cf.png" width="1979" height="1180" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The performance gains have been massive. If you load the same <code>.ply</code> in PlayCanvas versus our original viewer, the frame rate nearly doubles, and memory usage is reduced by 80%. If you compare SOGs to our previously most optimized format, the SOGs bundle is half the size with 3SH compared to 2SH and uses 88% less memory. Some critical resources consume over 95% less memory. So, yeah, we’re happy we made the switch.</p>
<p><strong>Were there any technical challenges you faced integrating PlayCanvas with 3DGS, and how did you overcome them?</strong></p>
<p><em>In Ha</em>: Well, we had to refactor the core of the application. We were moving a three.js-based application to a PlayCanvas-based application. We essentially had to rebuild every feature that was related to the viewer since the previous application was based on three.js - which is a common library that is used for 3D rendering on the web, and because we were using open source libraries built on top of three.js, a lot of refactoring was needed to adapt functionality to PlayCanvas and remove those external dependencies.</p>
<p>But we realized that essentially, the fundamentals are the same. They provide 3D renderers, which means they have 3D spaces, a camera, and some 3D objects (in this case, splats). PlayCanvas provides simple ways to control cameras and assets, and if we can read and write them, it doesn’t make much difference.</p>
<p>So we first detached every piece of the UI and event listeners, then replaced the core renderers, then everything followed naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share any interesting performance optimizations you’ve implemented in Reflct?</strong></p>
<p><em>In Ha</em>: We had done a reasonable amount of optimization work with the previous viewer, but the impact of those changes was trivial compared to moving to PlayCanvas.</p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: One thing that seems minor is the size of the viewer. A smaller viewer means fewer pixels to move around and less resource usage. People want big viewers, though, so we spent some time looking for the right balance between performance and visual impact.</p>
<p><strong>Reflct just launched after being in open beta — how has the feedback been so far?</strong></p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: The feedback has been quite positive, which is validating. Now that we are using the PlayCanvas engine, I think it will be even better. The performance improvement makes the application far more accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Who do you see as the ideal audience or customer for Reflct?</strong></p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: It's 3DGS capture pros who want to find a better way to commercialize their work, brands that want to elevate their product visualization, real-estate startups, or companies that are looking for an edge.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans for upcoming features or improvements?</strong></p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: First thing will be some improvements for mobile, just to improve consistency across devices. Then it’s integrations, viewer features, FTUX improvements, and building on our recent update for custom transition animations.</p>
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" controls="" src="/img/developer-spotlight-reflct-custom-animation.mp4" style="width:100%;height:auto"></video>
<p><strong>How can the PlayCanvas community try out Reflct or get involved?</strong></p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: It's free for up to 15 scenes on <a href="https://reflct.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://reflct.app</a>, so just jump in and try it out. If you have any ideas for improving the platform or seeing what we’re cooking up next, join the Discord; we’d love to hear from the community.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see 3DGS and web-based photorealistic content heading in the next few years?</strong></p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: The pace of innovation in 3DGS and other similar technologies is wild, but the trends seem to be around increasing quality, decreasing file sizes, and making the capture process simpler. Generative AI will also start to play a more significant role I’m sure, some of the recent experiments with generating 3DGS scenes using outputs from world models like Genie have been very impressive. I’d like to see some progress towards solving some of the drawbacks, like reflective surfaces.</p>
<p><em>In Ha</em>: I can see 3DGS becoming a general way of displaying rich, interactive, and impactful content.</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for developers looking to build commercial products on PlayCanvas?</strong></p>
<p><em>In Ha</em>: It is always important to just try things out. See what works and what doesn’t. Gather metrics and list out pros and cons. See if it solves your problem. Eventually, you will learn what is possible with PlayCanvas.</p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: Yeah, just get stuck in. PlayCanvas’ approach to open source is admirable.</p>
<p><strong>What’s been the most rewarding part of building Reflct so far?</strong></p>
<p><em>In Ha</em>: As we've been rolling out Reflct to the world, the most rewarding part has been the users and the community. When I see a user’s strikingly realistic content on Reflct, that’s the most rewarding for me.</p>
<p><em>Willie</em>: I'm just really proud of the product we’ve built together, it’s an awesome feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for chatting with us, In Ha and Willie!</strong></p>]]></content>

<p>When 3D Gaussian Splats began to revolutionize real-time rendering and photorealistic 3D content creation, we built <a href="https://superspl.at/editor?load=https://d28zzqy0iyovbz.cloudfront.net/db6ab60b/scene.compressed.ply" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">SuperSplat</a>, a visual editor for splats. But developers have continued to ask for better tools to manage, convert, and optimize their splat datasets. Our solution is to bring some of SuperSplat's most powerful features to the command line, courtesy of a new tool called <strong>SplatTransform</strong>. It's fast, flexible, and designed specifically for developers who need precise control over their Gaussian splat workflows.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-use-splattransform">Why use SplatTransform?<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/introducing-splat-transform-cli-tool#why-use-splattransform" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why use SplatTransform?" title="Direct link to Why use SplatTransform?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>SplatTransform solves important problems developers face when working with Gaussian splats:</p>
<p>🔄 <strong>Broad Format Support</strong> — seamlessly convert between PLY, SPLAT, KSPLAT, SOGS and even CSV<br>
<!-- -->🛠️ <strong>Powerful Transformations</strong> — translate, rotate, and scale your splats with precision<br>
<!-- -->🧹 <strong>Smart Filtering</strong> — remove NaN values, filter by properties, and strip unnecessary data<br>
<!-- -->📦 <strong>Scene Merging</strong> — combine multiple splat files into a merged scene<br>
<!-- -->⚡ <strong>Production Ready</strong> — optimized for maximum performance<br>
<!-- -->🆓 <strong>Open Source</strong> — completely free and available on GitHub</p>

<p>Instead of wrestling with format incompatibilities or writing custom scripts, you can now handle complex splat operations with simple, intuitive commands:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"># Convert between commonly used splat formats</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">splat-transform input.ksplat converted.ply</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"># Apply transformations during conversion</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">splat-transform input.ply -s 0.5 -t 0,0,10 -r 0,90,0 transformed.ply</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"># Combine multiple files with different transforms</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">splat-transform inputA.ply -r 0,90,0 inputB.ply -s 2 merged.ply</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"># Filter and optimize for production</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">splat-transform input.ply --filterNaN -c opacity,gt,0.3 --filterBands 2 filtered.ply</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The tool automatically handles the complexity of different splat formats while giving you granular control over every aspect of the transformation pipeline.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="unlock-data-science-workflows-with-csv-export">Unlock Data Science Workflows with CSV Export<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/introducing-splat-transform-cli-tool#unlock-data-science-workflows-with-csv-export" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Unlock Data Science Workflows with CSV Export" title="Direct link to Unlock Data Science Workflows with CSV Export" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>One of SplatTransform's most powerful features is its ability to export Gaussian splat data to CSV format, opening up entirely new possibilities for analysis and processing:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"># Export your splat data for spreadsheet analysis</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">splat-transform scene.ply data.csv</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"># Pre-filter before analysis to focus on relevant data</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">splat-transform input.ply --filterNaN -c opacity,gt,0.1 analysis.csv</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Why CSV matters for splats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Spreadsheet Analysis</strong> — Import directly into Excel, Google Sheets, or any data analysis tool</li>
<li class=""><strong>Statistical Insights</strong> — Calculate distributions, correlations, and quality metrics across your splat dataset</li>
<li class=""><strong>Custom Filtering</strong> — Use spreadsheet formulas to identify outliers, cluster data, or segment by properties</li>
<li class=""><strong>Visualization</strong> — Create charts and graphs to understand your splat data patterns</li>
<li class=""><strong>Integration</strong> — Feed splat data into machine learning pipelines or custom processing workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you're optimizing splat quality, analyzing capture patterns, or preparing data for research, CSV export transforms your splats from opaque binary files into readable, analyzable datasets.</p>

        <link href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/introducing-esm-scripts-in-playcanvas"/>
        <updated>2025-06-10T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re excited to announce a major step forward for PlayCanvas: ESM Scripts are now supported — and officially the recommended way to write scripts in your PlayCanvas projects.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>We’re excited to announce a major step forward for PlayCanvas: <strong>ESM Scripts are now supported</strong> — and officially the recommended way to write scripts in your PlayCanvas projects.</strong></p>
<p>Back in 2016, we introduced what we now call <a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-scripts-2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Classic Scripts</a>. At the time, this represented the state of the art in JavaScript. But things have evolved rapidly since then, and developers today expect modern tooling, clearer patterns, and better integration with the broader JavaScript ecosystem.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever struggled with managing classic scripts, wondered why your auto-complete didn’t work, or wished you could reuse code across projects more easily — this is for you.</p>
<p>ESM (ECMAScript Modules) brings modern JavaScript development to the heart of PlayCanvas. It’s faster to get started, easier to scale your project, and way more fun to work with. No more hidden globals. No more messy script loading order. Just well-structured, maintainable, and modular code — exactly how modern web development should be.</p>
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" controls="" src="/img/pc-esm-scripts.mp4" style="width:100%;height:auto"></video>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-use-esm-scripts">Why use ESM Scripts?<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/introducing-esm-scripts-in-playcanvas#why-use-esm-scripts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why use ESM Scripts?" title="Direct link to Why use ESM Scripts?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>ESM Scripts offer major improvements across the board:</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Modern JavaScript</strong> — use <code>import</code>, <code>export</code> class based module syntax<br>
<!-- -->🧠 <strong>Smarter Editor</strong> — better auto-complete and inline docs<br>
<!-- -->🧱 <strong>Modular Codebase</strong> — structure large projects cleanly with reusable modules<br>
<!-- -->⚙️ <strong>No Global Scope Issues</strong> — each script has its own context<br>
<!-- -->📦 <strong>Import Maps</strong> — define aliases and pull in libraries from CDNs<br>
<!-- -->🚀 <strong>Optimized for Production</strong> — static imports enable bundling and future support for tree-shaking</p>

<p>Instead of attaching scripts to an entity and hoping things load in the right order, you now write self-contained, class-based modules like this:</p>

<p>We didn’t just add ESM support because it was shiny. We added it because it solves real problems PlayCanvas developers have told us about for years.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">You get <strong>stronger editor feedback</strong> while writing code.</li>
<li class="">You can <strong>reuse logic cleanly</strong> across multiple scripts.</li>
<li class="">You can <strong>share modules between projects</strong> or publish them as libraries.</li>
<li class="">You’ll write <strong>fewer bugs</strong> — and spend less time wrestling with script order or context issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, by adopting a standard that the rest of the JS world already embraces, it’s easier than ever to onboard new developers and bring in existing tools and libraries.</p>

<p>Don’t worry — classic <code>.js</code> scripts aren’t going anywhere. If you have an existing project using them, everything still works. You can even mix classic and ESM scripts in the same project.</p>
<p>But going forward, <strong>ESM Scripts are the best choice</strong> for all new projects — and we think once you try them, you won’t want to go back.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, we are releasing <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/releases/tag/v2.7.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">PlayCanvas Engine 2.7.5</a> that introduces a new and advanced compression format for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) called Self-Organizing Gaussians (SOGS). <strong>SOGS can reduce 3DGS data by over 20x.</strong></p>
<p>To showcase PlayCanvas' support for SOGS, we have collaborated with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christoph-schindelar-79515351/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Christoph Schindelar</a> to build a technical demo:</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe id="viewer" width="800" height="500" allow="fullscreen; xr-spatial-tracking" src="https://playcanv.as/e/p/Zp9Oh1ia/"></iframe></div>
<p><em><strong><a href="https://playcanv.as/p/Zp9Oh1ia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">RUN FULLSCREEN IN A NEW TAB</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The church scene above was originally a <strong>1GB PLY file containing 4 million Gaussians</strong> - not at all suitable for the web or mobile! <strong>Using SOGS, we can serve up the scene in just 55MB!</strong> Read on to find out how.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="introduction-to-self-organizing-gaussians">Introduction to Self-Organizing Gaussians<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-adopts-sogs-for-20x-3dgs-compression#introduction-to-self-organizing-gaussians" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction to Self-Organizing Gaussians" title="Direct link to Introduction to Self-Organizing Gaussians" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>3D Gaussian Splatting has taken the real-time graphics world by storm, offering breathtaking photorealism. But as many developers have discovered, the incredible detail comes at a cost: massive file sizes. A typical high-quality scene can easily run into hundreds of megabytes, making them challenging for web delivery, mobile experiences, and quick load times.</p>
<p>This is precisely the problem that <a href="https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Self-Organizing Gaussians</a>, a groundbreaking compression technique from <a href="https://wieland.morgenst.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Wieland Morgenstern</a> at <a href="https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Fraunhofer HHI</a>, sets out to solve.</p>

<p>Each individual Gaussian in a 3DGS scene stores multiple parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Position (XYZ)</li>
<li class="">Scale (3 values)</li>
<li class="">Rotation (4 quaternion values)</li>
<li class="">Opacity</li>
<li class="">Base Color (RGB)</li>
<li class="">Spherical Harmonics (SH) coefficients for view-dependent effects (often 45+ values, contributing a huge portion to file size – up to 75%!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Storing all of these as high-precision floats is what leads to those hefty files.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="enter-sogs-reshape-reorganize-compress">Enter SOGS: Reshape, Reorganize, Compress<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-adopts-sogs-for-20x-3dgs-compression#enter-sogs-reshape-reorganize-compress" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enter SOGS: Reshape, Reorganize, Compress" title="Direct link to Enter SOGS: Reshape, Reorganize, Compress" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Instead of just quantizing individual values or creating simple codebooks for attributes (which are valid but more traditional compression steps), SOGS takes a far more innovative approach, directly inspired by how image compression algorithms work best:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Grid Reorganization:</strong> The fundamental idea is to take all the Gaussians and their attributes and reshape this data. Imagine "unrolling" all the Gaussians and laying their parameters out into a series of 2D grids or "attribute images." For instance, all X positions could form one 2D image, all Y positions another, each SH coefficient its own image, and so on (e.g., 59+ such images if you have 59 attributes per Gaussian). Initially, these images would look like random noise.</li>
<li class=""><strong>The "Self-Organizing" Sort (PLAS Algorithm):</strong> Here's the magic. SOGS employs a sophisticated sorting algorithm (<a href="https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/PLAS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Parallel Linear Assignment Sorting - PLAS</a>) to reorder the Gaussians themselves within these 2D grids. The goal is to arrange them so that Gaussians with similar properties (especially position, scale, and base color) become neighbors in the 2D grid. This process transforms the noisy, random-looking attribute images into much smoother, more structured images with lower frequency content.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Why sort?</strong> Compressing highly organized, smooth data (like a sorted image) is vastly more efficient than compressing noisy, random data. The difference can be dramatic (e.g., a 9x reduction for a sorted vs. random image with JPEG).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class=""><strong>Exploiting Smoothness:</strong> By sorting based on primary attributes (position, scale, base color), SOGS leverages the insight that Gaussians similar in these aspects are also likely to have similar secondary attributes (opacity, rotation, and those bulky SH coefficients). This "co-sorting" makes all the attribute images smoother.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Leveraging 2D Image Compression:</strong> Once these attribute images are smooth and organized, SOGS applies standard, highly optimized 2D image compression codecs to each one. In PlayCanvas, we have opted to use WebP. This is where the massive compression gains come from – the WebP codec is perfect for compressing smooth, predictable image data. Check out the image set for the church:

<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-impact-for-splat-developers">The Impact for Splat Developers<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-adopts-sogs-for-20x-3dgs-compression#the-impact-for-splat-developers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Impact for Splat Developers" title="Direct link to The Impact for Splat Developers" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Integrating SOGS into PlayCanvas is a game-changer for web-based 3DGS:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">🗜️ <strong>Massive File Size Reduction:</strong> We're talking serious compression! The church scene above, for example, was reduced from ~1GB to 55MB (a <strong>~20x reduction</strong>).</li>
<li class="">⚡ <strong>Lightning-Fast Loading:</strong> Smaller files mean your immersive 3DGS experiences load significantly faster, keeping users engaged.</li>
<li class="">📱 <strong>Mobile Feasibility:</strong> This level of compression makes deploying rich 3DGS content practical even on bandwidth or memory-constrained devices.</li>
<li class="">✨ <strong>Exceptional Visual Quality:</strong> SOGS is designed to maintain the high visual fidelity that makes 3DGS so compelling, and can even improve it by reducing artifacts.</li>
<li class="">🖼️ <strong>Simple Decoding:</strong> The compressed format is essentially a set of WebP images, which are trivial and fast to decode using standard browser capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>With SOGS support, PlayCanvas can deliver stunning, performant, and accessible 3D Gaussian Splat-based experiences directly in the browser. This is <strong>huge news</strong> for e-commerce, architectural visualization, education and entertainment industries.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="whats-next">What's Next<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-adopts-sogs-for-20x-3dgs-compression#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's Next" title="Direct link to What's Next" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>PlayCanvas Engine support is just the first step. Here's what's coming next:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Editor Support</strong> - Support SOGS data as a first-class citizen in the Asset Panel</li>
<li class=""><strong>SuperSplat Support</strong> - Add SOGS as an export format</li>
<li class=""><strong>Performance Optimization</strong> - Now that we can quickly load vast numbers of Gaussians on mobile, we will turn our attention to boosting frame rates</li>

<p>SuperSplat can now be found on a shiny new domain! From now on, point your browser at:</p>

<p>The SuperSplat Editor that you know and love can now be accessed at <a href="https://superspl.at/editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://superspl.at/editor</a>. Much easier to remember, don't you think?</p>

<p>Recently, we added the ability to export an HTML viewer of your splat from the SuperSplat Editor. Built on the powerful <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">PlayCanvas Engine</a> and our open source <a class="" href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/compressing-gaussian-splats#compressed-ply-format">Compressed PLY format</a>, it offers fast load times and high-performance rendering. However, <em>hosting</em> the HTML viewer was still your responsibility. And let's be honest, not everybody has the time or expertise to host their own website. So we've added a new feature to SuperSplat to make it easier to share your splats with others.</p>
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" controls="" src="/img/supersplat2-publish-1080p-social-60fps.mp4" style="width:100%;height:auto"></video>
<p>It's as easy as 1-2-3:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">Log in with your PlayCanvas account (or sign up if you don't have one).</li>
<li class="">Select <code>File</code> &gt; <code>Publish</code> when you've finished crafting your splat.</li>
<li class="">Fill out the publishing options form and hit <code>Publish</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! Your splat will be published to the web and you'll be given a URL to share with others.</p>

<p>Sure, it's great to be able to share your splats with others, but for that extra 'wow' factor, why not add a camera flythrough? SuperSplat Editor 2.0 introduces the Timeline that makes it a breeze to author great looking camera animations. Simply select a frame in the timeline, position the camera, and set a keyframe. Do this for as many frames as you want and you've got a camera flythrough!</p>

<p>With the ability to create camera animations, your splat projects are becoming more and more complex. To support this, we've added a new project file format so you can save your work between sessions. The extension of SuperSplat's new project file format is <code>.ssproj</code>.</p>
<div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info admonition_xJq3 alert alert--info"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><p>The <code>.ssproj</code> file format is actually just a ZIP file containing project data in JSON format, along with a set of PLY files storing the Gaussian Splat data.</p></div></div>
<p>The introduction of the new project file format has also prompted us to reorganize the <code>File</code> menu. <code>Open</code>, <code>Save</code> and <code>Save As</code> now only operate on <code>.ssproj</code> files. To import and export other file formats into your project (such as <code>.ply</code> or <code>.splat</code>) you can use the <code>Import</code> and <code>Export</code> options in the <code>File</code> menu.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since introducing PlayCanvas, we've seen developers the world over build amazing 3D experiences using the PlayCanvas Engine and Editor. But what if you are a React developer?</p>
<p>Today we're proud to announce the release of <strong><a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/react" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">PlayCanvas React</a></strong>, a new declarative way to build 3D content using <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">React</a>.</p>
<p><strong>PlayCanvas React</strong> is a thin React wrapper around the PlayCanvas API. It allows you to build rich 3D content in a declarative way that fully integrates with the React ecosystem. You can create rich, complex 3D content with assets, physics, gaussian splats, audio, and more, all while leveraging the powerful state management of React.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/playcanvas-react-mxfvg9?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.jsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">CodeSandbox</a> below. Slide open the code editor and play with the code in real time.</p>

<p>With <strong>@playcanvas/react</strong> you create a scene using entities and components, just like you would in the PlayCanvas Editor or Engine. Entities have position, rotation and scale. They're the building blocks of your scene. Components on the other hand add behavior to an entity. For example, adding a <code>&lt;Render/&gt;</code> component to an entity allows it to render a mesh.</p>

<p>If you’re already familiar with the PlayCanvas API, you’re already off to a good start! You’ll see that any component system available in the engine can be used out of the box including rigid bodies, collision, physics etc. Follow our <a href="https://playcanvas-react.vercel.app/docs/guide/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Getting Started Guide</a> and you'll be up to speed in no time.</p>
<p>If you're coming from a React background, you'll find it easy to integrate with existing React projects. Even if you’re new to PlayCanvas, you can pick up the basics in just a few hours.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-react">Why React?<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/declarative-3d-with-playcanvas-react#why-react" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why React?" title="Direct link to Why React?" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>React is loved by developers because it makes building user interfaces simple, intuitive, and predictable. With PlayCanvas React, you can now apply the same magic to 3D! Instead of writing complex, imperative code to create and manage 3D scenes, you can describe them declaratively, just like you do with HTML for a webpage. React’s component-based approach also makes it easy to reuse and organize your 3D content, so you can focus on creativity instead of boilerplate.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-about-the-editor-and-engine">What about the Editor and Engine?<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/declarative-3d-with-playcanvas-react#what-about-the-editor-and-engine" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What about the Editor and Engine?" title="Direct link to What about the Editor and Engine?" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p>The PlayCanvas Engine underpins everything. PlayCanvas React is simply a thin wrapper around the engine with a React friendly syntax. There's no strict rule for using one over the other, but if you're familiar with React and its ecosystem, you'll find PlayCanvas React fits well with your stack.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>The Editor on the other hand is a powerful browser-based tool for building rich 3D content. PlayCanvas React is another way of achieving the same goal. Whilst the Editor provides a full suite of tools for asset management, scene organization, and rapid iteration, PlayCanvas React is more about building 3D content from within your React code. If you enjoy a code-centric workflow or want to integrate 3D content directly into a larger React application, PlayCanvas React may be the perfect fit.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today marks a major milestone for the PlayCanvas Engine, the <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">open-source</a> JavaScript runtime that powers thousands of interactive graphical apps and tools on the web. We are bubbling with excitement to announce the release of version 2.0.0!</p>
<p>For the full details, visit our GitHub:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/releases/tag/v2.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><strong>RELEASE NOTES</strong></a></p>
<p>It's not every day we do a major version bump of the Engine. Let's take a walk down memory lane to see how we got here:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">October 2010: Coding of the Engine begins!</li>
<li class="">24 October 2011: <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/commit/e5bf014e738d5bfc92ece1d6c0f50ad71bf4dd90" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Engine migrated to GitHub</a></li>
<li class="">4 June 2014: <a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-goes-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Engine goes open source</a></li>
<li class="">24 April 2018: <a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-engine-reaches-1-0-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Engine hits 1.0.0</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Back in 2018, the Engine was bumped to 1.0.0 because we adhere to <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">semantic versioning</a> which dictates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be 1.0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should be 1.0.0. If you’re worrying a lot about backward compatibility, you should probably already be 1.0.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With hindsight, the Engine should probably have reached 1.0.0 some years before. It had long been stable and was already being used heavily in production!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-bump-to-200">Why Bump to 2.0.0<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-engine-hits-2-0-0#why-bump-to-200" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Bump to 2.0.0" title="Direct link to Why Bump to 2.0.0" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Semantic versioning says that you perform a major version bump when you introduce breaking changes. To say we go out of our way to avoid introducing breaking changes in an understatement. But since 1.0.0, we had done 73 minor versions along with countless patch releases. Along the way, the Engine accumulated a considerable amount of "cruft".</p>

<p>It was getting to the point where parts of the codebase were restricting our ability to advance the Engine's capabilities. And so, we took to the decision to do a spring clean. 🧹 Here are some highlights of what we removed:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>WebGL 1 support.</strong> This is the big one. Today, devices that support WebGL 1 but not WebGL 2 is less than 2% and this number is only going to get smaller. And supporting WebGL 1 was making it extraordinarily difficult to construct the foundations we needed in order to support WebGPU. Cheerio, WebGL 1 - it's been fun! 👋</li>
<li class=""><strong>Scripts 1.0 support.</strong> The very first <code>ScriptComponent</code> implementation was deprecated with the introduction of <a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-scripts-2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Scripts 2.0</a> back in 2016. So after 8 years of deprecation, it's gone! We are now focused on delivering our new ESM-based scripting system, due soon.</li>
<li class=""><strong>AudioSourceComponent.</strong> This component was the precursor to the Engine's <a href="https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/SoundComponent.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><code>SoundComponent</code></a>. <code>AudioSourceComponent</code> has been deprecated for many years so it's time for it to go.</li>
<li class=""><strong>...and several other public API symbols.</strong> What we are left with is a cleaner, tighter codebase that can power us into the future!</li>
</ul>

<p>Never fear! Today's release is more relevant to 'Engine-only' users who pull the engine from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/playcanvas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">NPM</a>. At a time of their choosing, these developers can upgrade to 2.0.0 and give it a try. The vast majority of projects will update without modification.</p>
<p>Editor users will gain access to Engine 2.0.0 in the coming weeks. At that point, moving to 2.0.0 will be <em>opt in</em> for existing projects. We plan to support the last Engine 1.x release in the Editor for at least a year after Engine 2 becomes available. This should be plenty of time for developers to migrate. New projects will automatically use 2.0.0. We will release more information about the transition for Editor users in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we ask NPM users to try Engine 2.0.0 and give us your feedback as soon as you can. We hope you like it!

<p>The application above shows several splats assembled in a single application, with animation and post effects spicing up the visuals. Let's check out how it was built.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="step-1-clean-in-supersplat-">Step 1: Clean in SuperSplat 🧹<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/create-3d-gaussian-splat-apps-with-the-playcanvas-editor#step-1-clean-in-supersplat-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: Clean in SuperSplat 🧹" title="Direct link to Step 1: Clean in SuperSplat 🧹" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>After <a href="https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/graphics/gaussian-splatting/#creating-splats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">capturing the statues</a> to PLY format, our first stop is <a href="https://playcanvas.com/supersplat/editor?load=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willeastcott/assets/main/statues/narcissus.compressed.ply" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">SuperSplat</a>, the open source tool for editing and optimizing 3D Gaussian Splats. Here, in a little over a minute, we can isolate the statue from the background and align it with the origin:</p>
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" controls="" src="/img/statue-supersplat.mp4" style="width:100%;height:auto"></video>
<p>Once we are done, we can download the splat using our <a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/compressing-gaussian-splats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">compressed PLY format</a>. In this case, our downloaded PLY is <strong>only 1.56MB</strong>!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="step-2-import-into-the-editor-">Step 2: Import into the Editor 🚧<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/create-3d-gaussian-splat-apps-with-the-playcanvas-editor#step-2-import-into-the-editor-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 2: Import into the Editor 🚧" title="Direct link to Step 2: Import into the Editor 🚧" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have a clean, compressed PLY, we simply need to drop it into the Editor's Asset Panel. And from there, drag it into the viewport to add it to the scene. Let's do that (along with a cube map for a photographic backdrop):</p>
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" controls="" src="/img/statue-editor.mp4" style="width:100%;height:auto"></video>
<p>The PlayCanvas Editor is a powerful visual environment for building and publishing 3D scenes. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Grab useful scripts (and other assets) from the Asset Store. Here, we import an Orbit Camera script.</li>
<li class="">Create beautiful user interfaces, using either HTML or PlayCanvas' built-in UI system.</li>
<li class="">Add sound, physics, VR/AR support and much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="step-3-add-animation-and-post-effects-">Step 3: Add Animation and Post Effects ✨<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/create-3d-gaussian-splat-apps-with-the-playcanvas-editor#step-3-add-animation-and-post-effects-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 3: Add Animation and Post Effects ✨" title="Direct link to Step 3: Add Animation and Post Effects ✨" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>What really makes the demo pop is the transitions that fade the statues in and out.</p>
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" controls="" src="/img/statue-custom-shaders.mp4" style="width:100%;height:auto"></video>
<p>With the Editor, you can customize the shader code that renders your splats to apply stunning animation effects. For the transition between statues, individual splats are transformed and recolored over time, while a full-screen bloom effect is ramped up and down.</p>

<p>Since its inception back in 2010, PlayCanvas has been layered on top of WebGL. In 2017, we were proud to launch support for <a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/mozilla-launches-webgl-2-with-playcanvas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">WebGL 2.0</a> in partnership with our friends at Mozilla. April 2023 marked the beginning of a new era for web graphics when Google enabled WebGPU by default in Chrome 113. Since then, WebGPU adoption has exploded and today, <a href="https://web3dsurvey.com/webgpu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Web3D Survey</a> reports that <strong>62.19% of end users can now run WebGPU</strong>. With <a href="https://caniuse.com/webgpu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Firefox and Safari due to launch their WebGPU support</a> in the not-too-distant future, expect this number to rise dramatically in 2024.</p>

<p>If you enable WebGPU for your PlayCanvas project, you may not notice much difference to begin with. In fact, we have put a great deal of effort into ensuring your WebGL projects look identical under WebGPU. But over time, there is are a great deal of opportunities to achieve performance improvements due to WebGPU's reduced driver overhead.</p>
<p>Another key feature unique to WebGPU is support for Compute Shaders which allow for general computation on the GPU. Support for Compute Shaders landed in <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/releases/tag/v1.70.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Engine v1.70.0</a>. Here you can see Computer Shaders in action simulating 1 million particles on the GPU:</p>

<p><a href="https://playcanvas.github.io/#/compute/particles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Click here</a> to run it for yourself in a WebGPU-enabled browser (i.e. Chrome or Edge).</p>
<p>In short, WebGPU represents the future for PlayCanvas and you can expect some incredible advances in performance and functionality over the coming months.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="getting-started-with-webgpu">Getting Started with WebGPU<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/build-webgpu-apps-today-with-playcanvas#getting-started-with-webgpu" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting Started with WebGPU" title="Direct link to Getting Started with WebGPU" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>WebGPU support in PlayCanvas is still considered 'Beta'. There are still some unimplemented features (for example, the run-time lightmapper is still not supported). Therefore, you have to currently 'opt in' to WebGPU support. To do this, open your Project's Settings in the Inspector and expand the <code>RENDERING</code> section. Then update <code>Graphics Devices</code> to include <code>WebGPU (beta)</code>.</p>

<p>Any PlayCanvas developer building directly on top of the Engine will very likely opt to use VS Code. But if you use the PlayCanvas Editor, you will normally rely on the built-in, browser-based Code Editor. Today, we're excited to give you another option by launching an open-source <strong>Visual Studio Code Extension for PlayCanvas</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="VS Code Extension" src="https://blog.playcanvas.com/assets/images/vscode-extension-b4cfbae14bf471ca2f0e5002a4287010.webp" width="1024" height="508" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>The PlayCanvas Code Editor is actually built on the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Monaco Editor</a>, the beating heart of VS Code. So why use VS Code instead of the PlayCanvas Code Editor?</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">GitHub Copilot</a> - leverage AI to help you write PlayCanvas code faster.</li>
<li class="">Powerful IntelliSense tools (code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists).</li>
<li class="">Leverage a huge library of other extensions to accelerate your development.</li>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Developer Site Landing Page" src="https://blog.playcanvas.com/assets/images/developer-site-landing-page-305b54e343c4f9e74e5dafa76d362ec9.png" width="2900" height="1966" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="migrating-from-metalsmith-to-docusaurus">Migrating from Metalsmith to Docusaurus<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/massive-upgrade-for-the-playcanvas-developer-site#migrating-from-metalsmith-to-docusaurus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Migrating from Metalsmith to Docusaurus" title="Direct link to Migrating from Metalsmith to Docusaurus" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Since PlayCanvas was born in 2011, the basic look of the Developer Site has changed little. The content was written in Markdown and converted to a static HTML site using a tool called <a href="https://metalsmith.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Metalsmith</a>. Customizing the site to our needs meant we had to write many Metalsmith plugins (for localization, navigation and more) and a lot of HTML and CSS to style the pages as we wanted.</p>
<p>13 years later, the world of static site generators has moved on with lots of exciting new options! We evaluated <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Docusaurus</a> and decided to migrate over to it.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="whats-new">What's New<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/massive-upgrade-for-the-playcanvas-developer-site#whats-new" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's New" title="Direct link to What's New" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>So what made Docusaurus so compelling? First up, the migration was going to be straightforward because, like Metalsmith, Docusaurus consumes Markdown and outputs a static site. And much of the customization we did for Metalsmith is supplied 'out-of-the-box' with Docusaurus. So that's all great. But the new site comes with lots of cool new features we known you're going to love:</p>

<p>We are not just launching a new Developer Site today. We are also launching our brand new, upgraded <a href="https://api.playcanvas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">API Reference Manual</a>!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="API Reference Site" src="https://blog.playcanvas.com/assets/images/api-reference-site-0bf03d9fab9da17fac2ed2dcd7c1d473.png" width="3840" height="2100" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="migrating-from-jsdoc-to-typedoc">Migrating from JSDoc to TypeDoc<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/massive-upgrade-for-the-playcanvas-developer-site#migrating-from-jsdoc-to-typedoc" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Migrating from JSDoc to TypeDoc" title="Direct link to Migrating from JSDoc to TypeDoc" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Since the start, we have relied on <a href="https://jsdoc.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">JSDoc</a> to generate our API reference manual. But since then, we have seen the introduction of <a href="https://typedoc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">TypeDoc</a> which offers some major advantages over JSDoc.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="-high-quality-default-theme">🎨 High Quality Default Theme<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/massive-upgrade-for-the-playcanvas-developer-site#-high-quality-default-theme" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🎨 High Quality Default Theme" title="Direct link to 🎨 High Quality Default Theme" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>While it's not perfect, the default TypeDoc theme is gorgeous and a big improvement over our custom JSDoc theme. It provides:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Light and dark modes (like the main developer site)</li>
<li class="">Links to the source code on GitHub</li>
<li class="">Grouping of API into related categories</li>
<li class="">Powerful search (press <code>/</code> to activate it)</li>
<li class="">...and much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a great foundation for us to begin with and we can customize the default theme to our requirements as needed.</p>

<p>Did you know that PlayCanvas develops frameworks and libraries other than the PlayCanvas Engine? There's <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">PCUI</a>, a front-end framework for web-based tools. There's the <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/editor-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">PlayCanvas Editor API</a> for automating the interface. And more! The new API reference collects all of the PlayCanvas APIs into a single manual.</p>

<p><a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><strong>3D Gaussian Splatting</strong></a> is a new method for digitizing and rendering real world objects. With gaussian splatting, you can digitize a scene from a few photos using services like <a href="https://lumalabs.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Luma Labs</a> or <a href="https://poly.cam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Polycam</a>. These services take the set of photos and generate a 3d Gaussian Splat scene in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">PLY format</a>.</p>
<p>For example, this is a Gaussian Splat scene rendered in PlayCanvas.</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://playcanv.as/p/69cnpevQ/" title="360 lookaround camera" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" allowvr="" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-is-a-splat">What is a Splat?<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/compressing-gaussian-splats#what-is-a-splat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is a Splat?" title="Direct link to What is a Splat?" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Gaussian Splat Scenes are not made up of polygons and textures. Instead, they are made up of many (up to millions) of individual, unconnected blobs called <em>splats</em>. A splat is just a particle in space with size, orientation, color and opacity.</p>
<p>Below you can see a single brown splat selected. The splat bounding box shows its orientation and size:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Splat Example" src="https://blog.playcanvas.com/assets/images/splat-example-6b4b739f779347c38f34dc3d592486e9.gif" width="900" height="600" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The gaussian part of the name comes from the shape of splat itself: the splat opacity has a gaussian falloff from its center to its edge.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="engine-support">Engine Support<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/compressing-gaussian-splats#engine-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Engine Support" title="Direct link to Engine Support" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The PlayCanvas team has been adding support to the engine for loading and rendering Gaussian Splat PLY files:</p>
<p><a href="https://playcanvas.github.io/#/loaders/splat-many" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Engine Example" src="https://blog.playcanvas.com/assets/images/gaussian-splat-example-c0776ca8356842a5c19f9d4d41172f77.gif" width="800" height="676" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>Since the resulting files are often messy and require cleaning, we released <a href="https://playcanvas.com/super-splat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">SuperSplat</a>, a tool for cleaning and processing gaussian splat PLY files:</p>
<p><a href="https://playcanvas.com/super-splat?load=https://code.playcanvas.com/viewer/guitar-cleaned.ply" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class=""><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="SuperSplat Example" src="https://blog.playcanvas.com/assets/images/super-splat-example-8005c919009f33017c7e2fbc204f1218.gif" width="800" height="676" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="ply-format">PLY Format<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/compressing-gaussian-splats#ply-format" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to PLY Format" title="Direct link to PLY Format" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>However, the default gaussian splat PLY format as exported by training tools is large.</p>
<p>This is because the uncompressed format stores a large amount of data <em>per splat</em>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Data Format</th><th>Bytes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Position</td><td>3 x float</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Orientation</td><td>4 x float</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Scale</td><td>3 x float</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Spherical harmonics / color</td><td>48 x float</td><td>192</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>232</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>For example, the original <code>guitar.ply</code> scene file takes <strong>132.8 MB</strong> (<strong>32 MB</strong> excluding spherical harmonic data).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="compressed-ply-format">Compressed PLY Format<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/compressing-gaussian-splats#compressed-ply-format" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Compressed PLY Format" title="Direct link to Compressed PLY Format" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>So we introduced a <em>compressed PLY</em> format for use in runtime applications. The compressed PLY file format ignores the unused spherical harmonic data and stores the rest of the elements in quantized integers.</p>
<p>The format can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Split the scene into chunks of 256 splats</li>
<li class="">For each chunk, store the min and max (x, y, z) for position and scale in floating point</li>
<li class="">For each splat in the chunk, store a normalized and quantized value for position and scale (relative to chunk extents) and orientation and color</li>
</ul>
<p>This data layout results in the following data <em>per chunk</em>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Data Format</th><th>Bytes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Position bound</td><td>6 x float</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Scale bound</td><td>6 x float</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>48</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>And the following data <em>per splat</em>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Data Format</th><th>Bytes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Position</td><td>uint32 (11, 10, 11)</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Orientation</td><td>uint32 (2, 10, 10, 10)</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Scale</td><td>uint32 (11, 10, 11)</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Color</td><td>uint32 (8, 8, 8, 8)</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>16</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>As a result, the compressed version of <code>guitar.ply</code> takes only <strong>8.7 MB</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="do-it-yourself">Do It Yourself<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/compressing-gaussian-splats#do-it-yourself" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Do It Yourself" title="Direct link to Do It Yourself" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The easiest way to generate a compressed PLY file yourself is using the <a href="https://playcanvas.com/super-splat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">SuperSplat tool</a>. Load the PLY file into SuperSplat and export it again using the 'Compressed Ply File' option:</p>

<p>We have introduced a new compressed PLY format for gaussian splatting which is roughly 4x smaller than uncompressed data and can be used in realtime applications.</p>
<p>In future we hope to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">store splats hierarchically for optimized rendering and culling</li>
<li class="">implement realtime splat LOD</li>
<li class="">test skinning and animation of gaussian splats</li>
<li class="">further compress gaussian splat data</li>
<li class="">optimize WebGPU rendering</li>
</ul>

<p>The compressed format is largely based on the fine work of Aras Pranckevičius and his <a href="https://aras-p.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">blog posts</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/avif-webp-land-in-editor"/>
        <updated>2023-10-11T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AVIF + WebP Support]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="AVIF + WebP Support" src="https://blog.playcanvas.com/assets/images/avif-webp-icons-271d3c27d8eb8a53d6d51975a6b11976.png" width="1480" height="644" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><strong>Today we're excited to announce that PlayCanvas now supports WebP and AVIF images natively in the editor. Two new, efficient image formats built for the web.</strong></p>
<p>This is not just an exciting update for us but a game-changer for anyone looking to optimize their projects for faster load times and better quality.</p>
<p>JPGs and PNGs have served us well. They're reliable and you can use them everywhere. AVIF and WebP are the new kids on the block. They offer better compression with a wider range of features like alpha channels, HDR and wide color gamut. But how do these formats work in practice and are they really that good? Let's dive in.</p>
<p><em>Take a look at the following images:</em></p>
<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/vmg4g3?fontsize=14&amp;hidenavigation=1&amp;theme=dark&amp;hidedevtools=1" style="width:100%;height:500px;border:0;border-radius:4px;overflow:hidden" title="react-compare-image (forked)" allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"></iframe>
<p>They look strikingly similar, but the file size tells a different story. The AVIF image on the left has a file size of just 18Kb, and the JPG counterpart over 4 times larger at 74Kb! This level of compression is not just impressive on its own. When you're working on a project with multiple textures, switching to AVIF and WebP formats could considerably reduce your overall load time.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you? Well, that's simple: it's all about efficiency and speed without sacrificing quality. Textures are one of the biggest assets in a 3D project and AVIF and WebP significantly reduce image sizes compared to traditional JPEGs and PNGs and that means faster load times and happier users. 🙌</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="avif-all-the-things">AVIF all the things?<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/avif-webp-land-in-editor#avif-all-the-things" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AVIF all the things?" title="Direct link to AVIF all the things?" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Ok, so browser support for AVIF is good, but not great according to <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=avif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">caniuse</a>, so always <a href="https://dev.to/nucliweb/detect-avif-image-support-to-use-in-your-css-4pen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">check support</a> and use the right format for your users. Different formats are better suited for different content. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, so we encourage you to explore various options and choose the one best for you.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="getting-started">Getting Started<a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/avif-webp-land-in-editor#getting-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting Started" title="Direct link to Getting Started" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Easy! Just start uploading your AVIF and WebP files into the Asset Panel, and for those of you wanting to convert your existing assets, you can now right-click on your asset in the Asset Panel and quickly convert your asset into a PNG, JPG, WebP or an AVIF.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Quick Convert" src="https://blog.playcanvas.com/assets/images/convert-animation-491144499116327bf154dfb8ad1b60c8.gif" width="1000" height="513" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So there you have it! This is not just a feature release; it's our way of saying we're listening and we care. We're excited to hear your thoughts on these new features. Give them a try and share your experiences with us.</p>
<p>Till then, keep creating, keep innovating!</p>]]></content>
