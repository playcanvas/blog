Today, we are thrilled to announce the launch of **SuperSplat Studio** — a brand new application for authoring interactive Gaussian splat-based experiences. Built on the [SuperSplat](https://superspl.at) platform, Studio takes your published splats to the next level, letting you craft rich, engaging presentations that tell a story.

### 📌 Annotations and Hotspots

SuperSplat Studio lets you place informational hotspots directly onto your splat. Each annotation consists of a title, a description and a camera viewpoint. When a viewer clicks a hotspot, the camera smoothly transitions to the saved viewpoint and reveals the annotation content.

This makes it easy to build educational walkthroughs, product showcases or guided tours of your 3D scenes. Simply position your camera, click to place a hotspot and fill in the details. You can add up to 25 annotations per scene and reorder them however you like.

The SuperSplat Viewer features a new **annotation navigation bar** that lets viewers cycle through all annotations in sequence. It's a great way to guide your audience through the key points of interest in your scene.

Check out this interactive honeybee by SuperSplat community member [Dany Bittel](https://superspl.at/user?id=danylyon) to see the new annotations in action:

### ✨ Post Effects

Want your splats to really pop? SuperSplat Studio gives you access to a comprehensive set of post effects powered by the [PlayCanvas Engine](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine). Apply cinematic polish to your scenes with just a few clicks:

- **Bloom** — Add a soft glow to bright areas for a dreamy, cinematic look.
- **Sharpen** — Crisp up fine details and make your splats look razor sharp.
- **Vignette** — Darken the edges of the frame to draw the viewer's eye to the center.
- **Color Grading** — Fine-tune brightness, contrast, saturation and tint.
- **Chromatic Fringing** — Add a subtle lens fringing effect for extra realism.

All effects update in real time as you tweak the sliders, so you can dial in the perfect look instantly.

### 🎨 Tonemapping and Background

SuperSplat Studio also gives you control over tonemapping and background color. Choose from a range of tonemapping operators including Linear, Filmic, ACES, ACES 2.0, Hejl and Neutral to get the tonal response you want. And set a custom background color to complement your scene or match your brand.

:::info
Bloom and other HDR-dependent effects require **High Precision Rendering** to be enabled. Toggle it on in the Scene settings panel to unlock the full range of post effects.
