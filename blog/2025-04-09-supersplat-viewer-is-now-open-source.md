Since its initial release back in November 2023, [SuperSplat](https://superspl.at/) has grown to be the most popular platform for editing and publishing 3D Gaussian Splats.

It allows you to publish your splats to our [superspl.at](https://superspl.at/) domain or download the SuperSplat Viewer for self-hosting. Regardless of which option you choose, you get the same viewer experience, giving you total flexibility. But while the SuperSplat Editor has been open source from the beginning, SuperSplat's web-based viewer has not. That changes today with the release of the viewer on [GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/supersplat-viewer) (under the MIT license).

### ✅ Viewer Features

So why use the SuperSplat Viewer to publish your splats? There are a lot of great reasons! Here is a run down:

* 🏃 **Performance** - it is built on the powerful [PlayCanvas Engine](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine) which delivers high frame rates.
* ✨ **Visual Fidelity** - the PlayCanvas Engine's advanced 3DGS shaders ensure top quality visuals.
* 🤳 **AR Support** - view your splat in your space in mixed reality.
* 🥽 **VR Support** - experience your splat in full immersion using any WebXR-capable headset.
* 🎬 **Animation** - play back attractive camera fly-throughs for your scenes.
* 🖥️ **Fullscreen Support** - take your splats fullscreen with the click of a button.
* 🎥 **Camera Modes** - switch between orbit and fly cameras, tuned for both mobile and desktop.

And this is just the beginning. We have ambitious plans for the viewer with exciting features just around the corner. So what's next? Well, one feature we are excited about it annotations, meaning you will be able to place informational panels within your scenes. Subscribe to the repo to get notified about new releases.
