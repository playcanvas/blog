Today we've added a new feature to help us bring the best projects and games from PlayCanvas to the fore.

[![Project Stars](/img/swooop-dashboard.jpg)](/img/swooop-dashboard.jpg)

<!-- truncate -->

If you visit any project home page, you'll see two new buttons.

## Watch

Watching a project tells us that you're interested in updates from this project. Soon we'll start customizing your feed with updates from the projects that you're watching. We'll also keep you updated via email with any major changes that happen to the project, like when they publish a new build.

## Star

Starring a project just tells us that you think it's cool. You won't receive any more information about it, but you can rest safe in the knowledge that you've given the project's owner a little boost to their day.

Start by browsing the projects on the [EXPLORE](https://playcanvas.com/explore/featured) page and show a little love to your fellow game makers.
