_CEO Will Eastcott at SXSW Accelerator_

This past week the PlayCanvas founders have been deep in the heart of Texas at the celebrated mega-festival SXSW. We were chosen from over 500 companies to pitch to a enormous room full of business leads, journalists and tech enthusiasts. Will was on stage and we wowed them successfully enough to get through the final 3. Sadly another talented start-up crew beat us to the No. 1 slot, but a close 2nd is still pretty damn good.

We've moved on from Austin now, and we're in San Francisco preparing plenty of exciting news and demos for the Game Developer Conference. We look forward to sharing lots more stuff with you this week!
