A video tutorial on how to make a Pong clone using PlayCanvas.

Will has put together a short video showing how you can make a Pong game using PlayCanvas. It will take you through creating Primitive shapes, how to use the built-in physics engine, and some gameplay scripting to move the player paddles. It's a great introduction to PlayCanvas and building games.
