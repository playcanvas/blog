Get hacking on a game instantly with our Platformer and FPS starter kits.

Today we've launched a new feature to help get you up and running in PlayCanvas super-quick. Instead of starting with the dreaded blank project, now you can instantly get yourself a game to start hacking on.

We've got two styles of game to start with.

You can select a starter kit via the **New Project** dialog. This is just the first two we've got up and running, with more improvements to come. Head over to the [forum](https://forum.playcanvas.com) with suggestions for more starter kits.
