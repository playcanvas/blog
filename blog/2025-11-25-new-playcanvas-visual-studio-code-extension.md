### 🚀 Overview


This release represents a major step forward from the previous version of the PlayCanvas VS Code Extension — bringing **deeper integration, improved collaboration, and stronger developer tooling**.

Here’s what’s new:

- **Realtime Asset Syncing:** Text-based assets now update instantly between VS Code and the PlayCanvas Editor, allowing seamless editing without manual uploads or refreshes.  
- **Live File Collaborators:** See who’s working in the same file at any given time, helping teams avoid conflicts and improve coordination.  
- **Full Type Checking for Scripts:** Enjoy comprehensive TypeScript support with inline error detection and autocomplete for all PlayCanvas script types.  
- **Disk-Mapped File System:** The extension now mirrors your PlayCanvas project structure locally on disk, unlocking improved integration with external tools — including **AI-powered agents and code assistants**.  

These upgrades make the extension faster, smarter, and better aligned with modern development workflows.
