Amazing news for PlayCanvas Users, iOS 8 is out.

So we've finally seen the launch of the [iOS 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_8). For all you PlayCanvas users out there, this is fantastic news as it means PlayCanvas games work straight off the web in mobile Safari on **hundreds of millions** of iPhones and iPads.

To celebrate this, we've launched a cool little demo to discover the new (and not quite released) iPhone 6. Take a look, and remember now it works on desktops, on Android and on iPhones and iPads!
