### Features and Fixes

- **New Gizmos** for you to play with. We've enhanced the Designer gizmo controls. See the screenshots and descriptions below.
- Fixed a small error when adding a script to a folder.
- Exporting your Packs has received a performance boost - it's now even quicker to show the world the results of your hard work.

### Updated Gizmos

**Translation Gizmo:** you can now move any selected entity in 2 dimensions at the same time by clicking on the planes in between the two axes you wish to translate the object over. Also, the view of the planes react to your viewpoint. For example, if you look at the model along the x axis you will only see the y-z plane.

**Scaling Gizmo:** a new uniform scale control has been added. Access it by clicking the new white block and drag the mouse to scale in all directions.

### UKIE Games Expo

Earlier this week, our esteemed CEO Will Eastcott felt like showing some people the future of web-based gaming and so headed off to the **Liverpool International Festival for Business** and [their games development showcase](https://www.events.ukti.gov.uk/creative-business-breakfast-and-uk-games-industry-showcase--ifb) to demonstrate the PlayCanvas platform.

### SWOOOP

[Philippa Moore](http://www.philippamoore.com/), the artist responsible for SWOOOP's brilliant 3D visuals, will be demoing SWOOOP at the [LadyCade](https://ladycade.org/) tonight (Friday 18th) at the [London Game Space](http://londongamespace.org/). Actually, while we're on the subject, now might be a good time to try and beat your high score. [Play it here](http://swooop.playcanvas.com/).
