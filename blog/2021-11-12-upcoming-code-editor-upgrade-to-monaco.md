We have almost completed work on moving the Code Editor from Code Mirror to [Monaco](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor), the same editor that powers the ever popular, Visual Studio Code.

_Look familiar? 👀_

With this upgrade, it will give developers:

- Much better performance, especially with large text files
- More editing functionality through the command palette
- Mouse driven features such as Cmd/Ctrl + Click to jump to definition, hover for documentation and a context menu!

There will be some small differences which will include:

- Syntax color changes as we've opted to use Monaco's default theme, which should be comfortably familiar to VS Code users
- Some hotkeys/shortcuts will be different (e.g moving a line up/down)

### When can we use it?

We are still working through a few issues but planning to release the Editor as early as next week. Keep your eyes peeled!
