We are nearing completion on transitioning our Code Editor from CodeMirror to [Monaco](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor), the powerhouse behind the immensely popular Visual Studio Code.

This upgrade will provide developers with:

- Significantly improved performance, especially when working with large text files.
- Enhanced editing features through the command palette.
- Advanced mouse-driven functionalities, such as Cmd/Ctrl + Click to jump to definition, hover for documentation, and a context menu.

There will be a few minor differences, including:

- Syntax color changes, as we are adopting Monaco's default theme, which will be familiar to users of VS Code.
- Some adjustments to hotkeys/shortcuts, such as moving lines up or down.

### When can we use it?

We are finalizing a few remaining issues but plan to release the upgraded Editor as early as next week. Keep your eyes peeled!
