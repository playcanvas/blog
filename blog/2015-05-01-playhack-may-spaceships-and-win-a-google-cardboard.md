**PLAYHACK May** is upon us. (Which means the PLAYHACK April winner will be announced soon)

Why not join us and create a **Space Game**. Lunar Lander, Space Invaders, Asteroids, Elite, are a few of the game styles you could try out. We're giving you 3 spaceship models and 2 asteroid models FREE to build your game with.

How does it work:

1. **Fork the [project](https://playcanvas.com/project/344381/overview/playhack-may-15)**
2. **Build a game by the 1st June**
3. **Winner's game will be featured on the site and will win a Google Cardboard.**

This month's **PLAYHACK** is the perfect opportunity to learn about the particle system component. We've added one for you, but why not create so other effects for your game. Smoke or worm-holes, for example.

#### Win a Google Cardboard

We'll pick our favorite entry (make sure you have a published build for us to play) at the end of the month, and we'll send the winner a **[Google Cardboard](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/)** which lets you browse VR scenes just using your phone. It's the future!
