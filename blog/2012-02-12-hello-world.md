Welcome to the PlayCanvas blog (and the new look website!).

So. Why are we here? We love making games. We love playing games. We love the internet. Hey, it seems like a lot of other people do too! Of course, you can make games and publish them out to the internet already. But wouldn't it be cool to be able to make a professional quality game wherever you are, on any device. And for that game to run on any device without having to make any changes? That's what PlayCanvas is all about.

If this strikes a chord with you, you will be pleased to hear that you don't have to wait to start building next generation HTML5 games with PlayCanvas. The tools are online, ready and waiting for you to build your next gaming masterpiece. All you need to do is contact us and you can join the closed beta before PlayCanvas rolls out publicly later on in the year.
