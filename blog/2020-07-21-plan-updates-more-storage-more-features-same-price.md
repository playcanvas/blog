Creativity makes our world a better place. PlayCanvas unlocks creativity through collaborative, frictionless tools that enable everybody to build, share and play together.

With PlayCanvas, getting started with game development is as simple as clicking on a hyperlink. No installation, available wherever you have access to a browser and easily shareable for a real-time collaborative workspace.

Until today, some aspects of the platform have been limited or restricted. This just holds back the creativity of our community. So today, we have some incredibly exciting news. We have updated our [plans](https://playcanvas.com/plans) to make our tools even more accessible for everyone at all levels!

[![New Plans](/img/plans-2020.jpg)](/img/plans-2020.jpg)

We are now giving everyone:

- 5-10x increase on storage for all tiers
  - Free: 200MB → 1GB
  - Personal: 1GB → 10GB
  - Organization: 10GB → 50GB
- [Customize the loading screen](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/designer/loading-screen/) - remove PlayCanvas branding
- [Download your apps](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/publishing/web/self-hosting/) - to host your game/app to your own server
- [Export and import project archives](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/profile/projects/#export-project-archive) - for making offline backups of your projects

Best of all, this comes at **no extra cost**! 🎉🎉🎉

If you're new to PlayCanvas, now is the perfect time to get started! We hope you enjoy these new features and updates.
