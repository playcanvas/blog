Today we're excited to launch the [WebVR Lab](http://webvr.playcanvas.com), a living project built by the PlayCanvas team to help developers learn about creating scalable and responsive WebVR applications for all devices.

Try the lab right now:

WebVR is a new standard that makes VR experiences accessible to the billions of web browser users and enables developers to reach a user on any type of VR headset. Using the web to deliver VR makes sharing experiences as easy as clicking a link, with no downloads required.

Chrome 56 for Android, launched this week, supports WebVR using the Daydream View headsets.

> “WebVR allows developers to build an experience that scales across all VR platforms from Google Cardboard and Daydream to desktop VR headsets, while also supporting 2D displays. Different platforms have different capabilities and the PlayCanvas WebVR Lab project gives developers an example of how to manage that diversity.”
> **Megan Lindsay, Google Product Manager for WebVR**

We launched our [official WebVR support](https://blog.playcanvas.com/webvr-support-in-playcanvas/) back in November and the WebVR Lab marks the company’s next step to ensure that developers can quickly and efficiently build the most beautiful WebVR experiences possible.

The WebVR Lab elegantly scales from a simple Cardboard headset to a full desktop VR setup. Devices supported by the project include Google Cardboard, Daydream View, GearVR, Oculus Rift (with Touch controllers) and HTC VIVE.

The project is to be continually updated with new experiments that implement core interactions for VR on the web. Including teleportation, manipulating virtual objects, user interface and controllers.

The first fruits of our work on the WebVR Lab is the [Tracked Controllers](https://playcanvas.com/project/457917/overview) project, where developers can take our sample code and quickly integrate the Daydream Controller into their project.
