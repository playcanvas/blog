Dominating the sea-front is the Grand Cannes, a vast 18 meter wide LED screen that sits atop the Grand Hotel. [DOOH](https://www.dooh.com/), a world leader in Digital Out Of Home experiences, wanted to create a gaming experience people could play on that screen to wow the world of advertising.

> "At DOOH, we're constantly devising new and refreshing ways to engage consumers as they go about their lives." said Andrew Newman, CEO of DOOH. "Gaming has a key role in that. So at Cannes Lions, we're enabling passers by to play the world's largest game of Space Invaders. And since everybody has a smartphone, everybody can play. Just visit a web link to load up the DOOHpad, our virtual controller. To build DOOH Invaders, we needed a partner who understands the intersection of gaming and advertising. The natural choice was PlayCanvas and they've built something truly special."
