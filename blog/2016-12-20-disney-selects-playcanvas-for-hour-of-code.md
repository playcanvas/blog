title: Disney Selects PlayCanvas for Hour of Code
---

We're proud to announce that Disney has selected PlayCanvas to power their newly launched Hour of Code application. Entitled "Moana: Wayfinding with Code", it's a free online tutorial to teach kids the basics of computer science.

In the tutorial, kids are tasked with using code to navigate Moana and Maui, two of the main characters, through the ocean. When they’re attacked, the students have to use their coding skills to dodge the pirates.

PlayCanvas enabled Disney to bring the beautiful visuals of Moana to the browser via WebGL-based, realtime 3D graphics.

PlayCanvas' web-first approach makes it incredibly easy to incorporate other web technologies such as Google's Blockly and more besides. But it also gives great performance, particularly on mobile. And the tiny footprint of the 160KB engine makes for lightning fast download times and rock-solid stability all the way down to iPhone 4S.

[Try "Moana: Wayfinding with Code" now](https://hourofcode.com/moana) and see how Disney is leading the way in encouraging our younger generation to become tomorrow's software engineers.
