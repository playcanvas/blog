We're taking the pain away from converting and uploading assets.

We're really excited to announce the launch of our new asset pipeline feature, which allows you to import all your assets into PlayCanvas via your web browser.

You will no longer have to download and install command line tools to convert your art into the PlayCanvas format. Simply drag an FBX or COLLADA file into the browser and we'll do the rest.

Will has put together this 5 minute video which shows you how quickly you can get a model and animation from a site like [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) into your PlayCanvas game.
