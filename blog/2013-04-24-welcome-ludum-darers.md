[Ludum Dare 26](https://ludumdare.com/) is coming up this weekend. To celebrate we're giving anyone who wants to enter using PlayCanvas instant access to our closed Beta. To double celebrate if you submit a game using PlayCanvas we'll give you a full year's subscription to the Indie plan when we go public in a few weeks. That's over $150 worth of HTML5 game-dev goodness right there.

To get involved, email [info@playcanvas.com](mailto:info@playcanvas.com) or just go and [sign up](https://playcanvas.com/). Make sure to mention **LD48** and your LD48 username so we can check out what you make.

We'll be entering ourselves as usual (you can see our [previous entries](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/author/daredevildave/)) and probably much of the weekend will be on [#playcanvas](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=playcanvas&uio=d4) IRC channel on freenode. So if you enter and you want help, support or just to chat about what your making come join us.

Remember, it's good idea to get familiar with your tools before a game jam, so sign up today and get some practice in.
