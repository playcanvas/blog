Our most popular PLAYHACK ever finishes today. Last month's gem challenge sparked your creativity and led to over 30 forks of the project.

## Featured Winner

This month our favorite PLAYHACK game is [Yet Another Gems](https://playcanv.as/p/p87UuuNV) by [rzinurov](https://playcanvas.com/user/rzinurov). A great 3D twist on a classic format. We were most impressed by the polish of the game. From the full menu and UI, to the the inclusion of online leaderboards using [Google Play Services](https://developers.google.com/games/services/web/gettingstarted), this is a complete game. An impressive achievement for only one month's development.

Here's a selection of some of the games made this month. Special mention to [runninglvlan](https://playcanvas.com/user/runninglvlan) who only started making his game [Gem Labyrinth](https://playcanv.as/p/snqvkNes) 12 days ago, but already has an addictive maze running game (my record is 130 points in 47 seconds)

Go watch and star the game projects for [Gem Labyrinth](https://playcanvas.com/project/336187/overview/gemlabyrinth) and [Yet Another Gems](https://playcanvas.com/project/335386/overview/yet-another-gems).

## Make your loved one a game

With the end of one PLAYHACK must come the start of a new one. February 14th is St Valentine's Day, so this month's theme is to give you the chance to create the ultimate Valentine's Day gift. Make your loved one their own special game.

We're giving you 20 hearts of all shapes and sizes, and not only that, there is a loveable furry surprise in the pack too.

Valentine's Day is only 2 weeks away, so don't wait around. If you miss the 14th though, don't worry, our deadline is the end of the month. And we'll still love you whenever you finish.

### How does it work?

1. Fork this month’s [project](https://playcanvas.com/project/336903/overview/playhack-feb-15) into your account

2. Use 3D models from the project to build a new game.

3. Post to your Devlog about your game throughout the month

4. At the end of the month we'll look at all the forks

5. We’ll pick our favorite and feature it on the [explore page](https://playcanvas.com/explore/featured)

As there are so many models this month, feel free to pick and choose a few that you need.

### Judging

The process of judging is as broad as the rules. You won’t be marked on the strength of code, graphics of theme, the winning game will be the game that we enjoy the most, simple.

### What will you build?

This month we want to start up a discussion about what you can build.

We've got some ideas about what games suit the the theme and what would work best as a unique and personal gift for a loved one. But what do you think? Join the discussion [in the forum](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/playhack-february-game-ideas/539).

Enough from us though.
