Back in October, [we launched PCUI](https://blog.playcanvas.com/introducing-pcui-an-open-source-ui-framework-for-the-web/), an easy to use framework for building web-based tools. It already powers the PlayCanvas Editor and [glTF Viewer](https://playcanvas.com/viewer) applications.

Today, we're excited to announce our next major release for the library: PCUI 1.1.0. Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui/releases/tag/v1.1.0) for the details. But let's take a look at some of the highlights.

### TreeView - Tree Control

Many web tools display data in a hierarchical or tree-based representation. But building a tree control in HTML and CSS can be tricky. PCUI 1.1.0 introduces a very easy to use tree control. And it incorporates some useful features such as:

- Drag and drop of tree view items
- Built-in 'double-click to rename'

### ArrayInput - Array Control

Also arriving in PCUI is `ArrayInput`. It allows you to create input controls for arrays of numbers, strings, booleans or vectors.

### Resizable TextAreaInput Control

The `TextAreaInput` control has been augmented with a new resizable property that can be set to `none`, `horizontal`, `vertical` or `both`.
