PLAYHACK April ended last week and we've spent the weekend rolling balls and dodging platforms.

<!-- truncate -->

Many strong entries this month, but we chose our winner based on how they delivered the complete package. **Over 32 levels designed**, audio, user interface, a tutorial. And it becomes the second PLAYHACK game to make it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marbleous/jbcgphppffkahpoiobhfdjfpbapbjblh).
