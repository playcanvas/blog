We're introducing new plans for PlayCanvas users.

## More pricing options

When we started the PlayCanvas Pro accounts we wanted to keep it simple and give you an option to work in private on your projects.

Today we've [launched new plans](https://playcanvas.com/plans) which extend our two existing plans based on your feedback to better fit your needs.

### What's changed?

We've split our plan structure into two. **Pro** plans are for personal users and indie studios who want to work in private with increased storage. **Org** plans are for organizations and companies who want a little bit extra. All our **Org** plans come with our **Bronze Support** plan so you have access our development team when you need help.

Our original plans (Pro and Business) have simply been renamed to **Pro 5** and **Pro 10** and of course the **Free** plan stays free.

See the new plans below and take a look our [pricing page](https://playcanvas.com/plans).

### Support

We're also introducing our Support plans for companies that want an extra level of security and care for their development projects. If you are interested in our Support plans [get in touch](mailto:sales@playcanvas.com) and we can talk you through the options.
