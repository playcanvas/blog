Big changes to some of the underlying architecture of PlayCanvas this week. The powerful features that let you edit your scenes collaboratively with other users where ever they are in the world now applies to all Asset data too.

This means you can update your materials, cubemaps and textures and share those changes in real-time with your team mates around the world.

This isn't just about collaborating with remote friends though. Our unique ability to synchronize your scene across the internet means that you can edit you scene on your desktop and watch in wonder as it live updates on a mobile device. Perfect for testing on all platforms.
