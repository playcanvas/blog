With today's launch you'll have instant access to Sketchfab's enormous library of high quality 3D content right inside the Editor.

### What Is Sketchfab?

[Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) is a platform that allows users to publish, share and discover 3D content on the web. You can think of it as a sort of "YouTube for 3D models". The platform hosts millions of 3D models in various formats, including glTF, OBJ, STL, and more.

Users can upload their 3D models to Sketchfab and embed them in other websites much like one would embed a YouTube video. This has made it popular for showcasing 3D models for a wide range of uses including game assets, 3D scans, architectural models, and educational content.

### Accessing Sketchfab from the Asset Store

Earlier this month, we [announced](https://blog.playcanvas.com/announcing-the-new-playcanvas-asset-store/) the brand new PlayCanvas Asset Store. The Asset Store is an in-Editor panel of useful assets that you can use in your projects. With a few clicks, you can browse, discover and import various types of content. So it is the obvious place to incorporate the vast Sketchfab content library.

To access the Sketchfab library, simply hit the Asset Store button on the Asset Panel header and select the SKETCHFAB filter on the left.

### Authorizing PlayCanvas to Access Sketchfab

If you want to import models from Sketchfab into PlayCanvas, you first need to create a Sketchfab account. Then, the first time you try to import a Sketchfab model in the Asset Store, you will be asked to authorize PlayCanvas to access your Sketchfab account.

It's so quick and easy!

### New License and Author Info for Assets

Sketchfab assets are all tagged with a license and an author. When you import Sketchfab content into your PlayCanvas projects, it's important that we preserve this information. Now, when you click on any imported asset, you'll see we've added links to license and author information in the Inspector panel.

This ensures that the author's licensing wishes are respected and that they recieve credit for their work.
