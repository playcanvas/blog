title: PLAYHACK March - Win a Chromebook 2
---

This month we have an extra special PLAYHACK, our monthly game jam, to announce. We've teamed up with **ARM**, to bring you both a excellent new 3D Model to start your game with, but also an excellent prize.

## PRIZE

This month the author of our favorite PLAYHACK game will walk away with a **Chromebook 2**, the ARM powered laptop that's perfect for game development with PlayCanvas!

Here are the specs:

Samsung Chromebook 2 13.3”

- Samsung Exynos 5 Octa (5800)
- ARM® Mali™-T628 MP6 GPU
- ARM Cortex®-A15 MP4 and Cortex-A7 MP4 CPUs
- ARM big.LITTLE™ processing

To win this lovely bit of kit we want you to build a game, and to help you build that game ARM has supplied us with this beautiful Buggy Model.

We've set up the vehicle physics for you (but feel free to re-write that if you like). All you need to do is come up with an interesting idea for a game (Racing, Stunt driving, Buggy Football!) and code it up. You don't even need to make the buggy the center of attention, as long as it's in your scene you're good.

Short on ideas? Check out the [forum thread](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/playhack-march-game-ideas/571) to join the idea discussion.

## HOW TO ENTER

Entering is simple. Visit the [PLAYHACK March project](https://playcanvas.com/project/338302/overview/playhack-mar-15) and click the FORK button. This creates a new project for you to build your game in. At the end of the month (Midnight on the 31st March to be precise) we'll check all the public projects that have been forked from the original and work with ARM to select a winner.

Style points (these don't count towards winning) will be awarded for posting updates to your Devlog throughout the project and sharing screenshots, daily builds and updates through PlayCanvas, Twitter, Facebook and anywhere else.

What are you waiting for?
