Last week, I did a talk at the [London Game Space](http://londongamespace.com) about game development trends and how it is influencing what we are doing at [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com).

The event was recorded and you can see a video of the slides and my talk below. It was as [Pecha Kucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha) style talk which means 20 slides, with each slide lasting 20 seconds. So it's less than 7 minutes long.

I think it does a good job of showing why we're building PlayCanvas.
