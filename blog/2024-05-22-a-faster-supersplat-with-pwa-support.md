Today, we are announcing the latest release of [SuperSplat](https://playcanvas.com/supersplat/editor), the open source tool for editing and optimizing 3D Gaussian Splats.

[Version 0.17.1](https://github.com/playcanvas/supersplat/releases/tag/v1.17.1) focuses on two key areas: performance and PWA support.

## Performance Improvements

SuperSplat is now *over 2x faster on the GPU*! üèÉ

Compare before and after (notice GPU time dropping from 32ms to 13.5ms for the bike scene):

This is thanks to the [v1.71.0 release](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/releases/tag/v1.71.0) of the PlayCanvas Engine, which includes a dramatic overhaul of how splats are processed by the GPU. For the technical details, take a look at [this pull request](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/6357).

The result is that SuperSplat can now throw around millions of splats and still maintain a silky smooth frame rate. Try it for yourself!

## PWA Support

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web application that provides a native app-like experience, including the ability to install it on a user's home screen or desktop.

From today, SuperSplat is shipping with PWA support! üéâ
