**Rockets! Robots! UFOs!** PLAYHACK with PlayJam starts now.

We've teamed up with PlayJam and our 6 week game jam starts today. Check out the assets and theme, get your thinking hats on, then go and fork the project and get started.

## Assets

We’ve got three great assets for your game. Use one, two or all three in your game.

## Theme

Apart from the obvious theme of **Rockets! Robots! UFOs!** There is a secondary theme which ties into making your game available on PlayJam’s upcoming mobile game network:

### Challenge your mates

We want games that you and your friends can compete in. That could be something simple like a high score table or getting the fastest lap time or something as complicated as network multiplayer (not for the faint-hearted). What we’re looking for is for people to shout _“Beat that!”_ after playing.

### Mobile first

We want games that work well in mobile browsers. That means touch support, landscape or portrait design and great simple mechanics. Ideally, they’ll work on desktop too, but mobile phones are the target.

## Prizes

Did we mention that there are incredible prizes to win! Seriously awesome ones.

- **1st Prize - £2000** (~$2800)
- **2nd Prize - £1000** (~$1400)
- **3rd Prize - £500** (~$700)

Judging will start on the 12th March and we’ll only play builds that are published before that day.

## How To Enter

- Fork the [PLAYHACK project](https://playcanvas.com/project/374578/overview/playhack-feb-16) into your account
- Build your game using your newly forked project.
- Use the 3D assets we supply and pay attention to the theme.
- Post to your devlog about your game throughout the competition.
- The competition ends on the 11th of March. Make sure you’ve published your game by then!
- PlayJam and PlayCanvas will pick the best of the best.
- Winners will get cash prizes and the chance to be published on the PlayJam Network.

To summarize: _Fork the project, build a game, publish on PlayCanvas._

So with all that out of the way. Think deep about the themes and start building that awesome game.
