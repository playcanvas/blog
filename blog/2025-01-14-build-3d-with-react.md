Since we introduced PlayCanvas, we've seen many developers around the world build amazing 3D experiences using the PlayCanvas Engine and Editor.

Today we're proud to announce the release of **[Playcanvas React](https://github.com/playcanvas/react)**, a new declarative way to build 3D content using [React](https://react.dev/).

[@playcanvas/react](https://github.com/playcanvas/react) is a thin react wrapper around PlayCanvas. It allows you to build rich 3D content in a declarative way that integrates with the React ecosystem. You can create rich, complex 3D content with assets, physics, gaussian splats, audio and more whilst leveraging the powerful state management of React.

But don't take our word for it. Check out the interactive [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/playcanvas-react-mxfvg9?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.jsx) below. Slide open the code editor and play with the code in real time.

### A new way to build 3D apps

If you're familiar with React, you'll feel right at home with [Playcanvas React](https://github.com/playcanvas/react). The library is designed to be easy to use and seamlessly integrates with existing React projects. Even if you’re new to React, you can pick up the basics in just a few hours.

[PlayCanvas React](https://github.com/playcanvas/react) is already being used today in [production ready apps](https://ai.snapchat.com/) and we’re excited to see how developers like you will leverage it to create stunning 3D experiences.

To get started you can follow the [installation and getting started guide](https://playcanvas-react.vercel.app/docs/installation), then check out the **[repo](https://github.com/playcanvas/react)** and explore some of the **[examples](https://playcanvas.com/docs/api/react/playcanvas.react.html#examples)** in the live playground.
