So what's attracting incredible companies like these to PlayCanvas? It's because they need WebGL tooling that works. [Other game engines have let them down](https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-versus-unity-webgl/) and PlayCanvas is delivering the technology they need.

#### Cool Games

Plenty of PlayCanvas games have been released during 2016 but we have to give special mention to Midgard's [BlastArena](http://blastarena.io)! It pays homage to the classic Bomberman with frenetic, insanely fun online play.
