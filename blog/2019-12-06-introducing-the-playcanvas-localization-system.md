Are you shipping your PlayCanvas app or game in just one language? You may be preventing international users from enjoying it! Today, we are happy to announce the arrival of a localization system built right into the PlayCanvas Editor!

The system works in tandem with PlayCanvas' text element component and it's super-easy to use. The text element interface now provides a 'Localized' property and when checked, you can enter a Key instead of a Text string.

The Key is the string used to look up a localized string based on the user's currently selected locale. The localized string data is stored in JSON assets and is documented, along with the rest of the system, [here](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/user-interface/localization/). You can even preview your localized User Interface by choosing a locale in the Editor Settings panel:

We look forward to playing your newly localized games!
