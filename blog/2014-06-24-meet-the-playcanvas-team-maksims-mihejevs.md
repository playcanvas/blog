Today we are talking to the Russian (from Latvia) Senior Engineer at [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com): Max!

**How did you get into the video games industry?**

I started making games when I was 13 years old and always knew what I wanted. A long journey but here I am, making game development better with PlayCanvas.

**Can you briefly describe your role at PlayCanvas?**

I’m a Full-stack developer and love to be involved in anything specific or generic. Making PlayCanvas service work fast and scale well is what makes me feel good.

**What is your favorite aspect of PlayCanvas' service?**

It is in the browser (1-click-away), and JavaScript.

**Where do you see web based gaming in the future?**

There are so many ways gaming in web can be moved forward, that we even can't see where it will be in few years, only guess. The most important thing is well-connected and social games, where by just sharing a link you can invite your friends to challenge your record or even play in real-time with you.

**How is PlayCanvas going to change the way people make games?**

Collaboration and the fact you can make games straight away and test them out in minutes on hundreds of users, like your twitter followers. It’s something so powerful. We can't predict what users will come up with being so accelerated by those features.

**Can you describe one interesting thing about yourself?**

I do care about things going on around and will always get obsessed by things I work on, I want to get as much as possible from my efforts.

#### The Quick Fire round (this is where things get a little interesting)

**Zelda or Final fantasy?**
