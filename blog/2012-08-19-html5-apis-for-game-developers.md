One of the best and worst things about making games for web browsers is that the platform is a moving target. New features are constantly proposed, specced out and implemented. At the moment while many features are in a nascent state, keeping track of which features are available in which browsers is a bit of a pain.

This page is an effort to supply a list of HTML5 APIs that I think game developers want to know about and their availability in different browsers. Hopefully we'll gradually see this all go green.

### Updates

- **2012-10-09** - PointerLock support lands in Chrome stable
- **2012-09-11** - Mozilla announced they have started work on Web Audio API

[caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) is great resource for checking which features are available in which browsers. It was used as a source for many of the tables above.
