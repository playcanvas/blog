# PlayCanvas Blog

This is the source repository for the [PlayCanvas Blog](https://blog.playcanvas.com/). It is made up of static web content generated from Markdown files using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).

## How to build

Building the site requires an installation of Node.js 18+.

```sh
cd blog
npm i
npm run build
```

## How to serve

To serve the built site locally:

```sh
npm run serve
```

This will automatically open the built site in your browser.

## Use 'start' for quick iteration

The `start` build command will automatically rebuild the site when changes are made in the `docs`, `src` or `static` folders.

```sh
npm run start
```
