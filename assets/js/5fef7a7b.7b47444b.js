Over time, though, we saw what the PlayCanvas team was doing and ultimately made the decision to switch over. It\u2019s open source, reliable, performant, and just really, really good. You guys are doing great work \u2014 I wish we had made the shift sooner."]}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(t.em,{children:"In Ha"}),": It's fast and simple to use."]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Let\u2019s talk about Reflct.

It\u2019s as mind-blowing to me now as it was when the Inria paper first dropped. But most \u2018normal\u2019 people don\u2019t know how to navigate a 3D space in the browser, particularly on mobile, and you can really get lost in a 3DGS scene. We let creators control what a user sees in their scene by setting specific viewpoints, with orbit limits that control how much the user is able to move around. Each viewpoint can carry metadata which can be used for commerce integrations or custom features. Rich tools and features for creators, with a super simple viewer that non-technical people can navigate."]}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(t.em,{children:"In Ha"}),": It is also important to mention that we provide tools to help users implement their 3DGS assets on their websites, with the same navigation configured in our dashboard. This makes the whole integration process a lot easier. Our React library is one, and our Shopify component is another.
