But as many developers have discovered, the incredible detail comes at a cost: massive file sizes. A typical high-quality scene can easily run into hundreds of megabytes, making them challenging for web delivery, mobile experiences, and quick load times.\\n\\nThis is precisely the problem that [Self-Organizing Gaussians](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians), a groundbreaking compression technique from [Wieland Morgenstern](https://wieland.morgenst.de/) at [Fraunhofer HHI](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/index.html), sets out to solve.\\n\\n### The Core Challenge: Taming the Data Deluge\\n\\nEach individual Gaussian in a 3DGS scene stores multiple parameters:\\n\\n* Position (XYZ)\\n* Scale (3 values)\\n* Rotation (4 quaternion values)\\n* Opacity\\n* Base Color (RGB)\\n* Spherical Harmonics (SH) coefficients for view-dependent effects (often 45+ values, contributing a huge portion to file size \u2013 up to 75%!)\\n\\nStoring all of these as high-precision floats is what leads to those hefty files.\\n\\n### Enter SOGS: Reshape, Reorganize, Compress\\n\\nInstead of just quantizing individual values or creating simple codebooks for attributes (which are valid but more traditional compression steps), SOGS takes a far more innovative approach, directly inspired by how image compression algorithms work best:\\n\\n1. **Grid Reorganization:** The fundamental idea is to take all the Gaussians and their attributes and reshape this data. Imagine \\"unrolling\\" all the Gaussians and laying their parameters out into a series of 2D grids or \\"attribute images.\\" For instance, all X positions could form one 2D image, all Y positions another, each SH coefficient its own image, and so on (e.g., 59+ such images if you have 59 attributes per Gaussian). Initially, these images would look like random noise.\\n2. **The \\"Self-Organizing\\" Sort (PLAS Algorithm):** Here\'s the magic. SOGS employs a sophisticated sorting algorithm ([Parallel Linear Assignment Sorting - PLAS](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/PLAS)) to reorder the Gaussians themselves within these 2D grids. The goal is to arrange them so that Gaussians with similar properties (especially position, scale, and base color) become neighbors in the 2D grid. This process transforms the noisy, random-looking attribute images into much smoother, more structured images with lower frequency content.\\n    * **Why sort?** Compressing highly organized, smooth data (like a sorted image) is vastly more efficient than compressing noisy, random data. The difference can be dramatic (e.g., a 9x reduction for a sorted vs. random image with JPEG).\\n3. **Exploiting Smoothness:** By sorting based on primary attributes (position, scale, base color), SOGS leverages the insight that Gaussians similar in these aspects are also likely to have similar secondary attributes (opacity, rotation, and those bulky SH coefficients). This \\"co-sorting\\" makes all the attribute images smoother.\\n4. **Leveraging 2D Image Compression:** Once these attribute images are smooth and organized, SOGS applies standard, highly optimized 2D image compression codecs to each one. In PlayCanvas, we have opted to use WebP. This is where the massive compression gains come from \u2013 the WebP codec is perfect for compressing smooth, predictable image data. See the images set for the church below:\\n    [![SOGS Textures](/img/sogs-textures.jpg)](/img/sogs-textures.jpg)\\n\\n### The Impact for Splat Developers\\n\\nIntegrating SOGS into PlayCanvas is a game-changer for web-based 3DGS:\\n\\n* \ud83d\udddc\ufe0f **Massive File Size Reduction:** We\'re talking serious compression! The church scene above, for example, was reduced from ~1GB to 55MB (a **~20x reduction**).\\n* \u26a1 **Lightning-Fast Loading:** Smaller files mean your immersive 3DGS experiences load significantly faster, keeping users engaged.\\n* \ud83d\udcf1 **Mobile Feasibility:** This level of compression makes deploying rich 3DGS content practical even on bandwidth or memory-constrained devices.\\n* \u2728 **Exceptional Visual Quality:** SOGS is designed to maintain the high visual fidelity that makes 3DGS so compelling, and can even improve it by reducing artifacts.\\n* \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f **Simple Decoding:** The compressed format is essentially a set of WebP images, which are trivial and fast to decode using standard browser capabilities.\\n\\nWith SOGS support, PlayCanvas can deliver stunning, performant, and accessible 3D Gaussian Splat-based experiences directly in the browser. This is **huge news** for e-commerce, visualization, architectural visualization, education and entertainment industries.\\n\\n### What\'s Next\\n\\nPlayCanvas Engine support is just the first step. Here\'s what\'s coming next:\\n\\n* **Editor Support** - Support SOGS data as a first-class citizen in the Asset Panel\\n* **SuperSplat Support** - Add SOGS as an export format\\n* **Performance Optimization** - Now that we can quickly load vast numbers of Gaussians on mobile, we will turn our attention to boosting frame rates\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Our Open Source Mission\\n\\nWe proudly provide the PlayCanvas Engine as an MIT-licensed open source project.

Much easier to remember, don\'t you think?\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf10 Publish your Splats to the Web\\n\\nRecently, we added the ability to export an HTML viewer of your splat from the SuperSplat Editor. Built on the powerful [PlayCanvas Engine](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine) and our open source [Compressed PLY format](/compressing-gaussian-splats#compressed-ply-format), it offers fast load times and high-performance rendering. However, _hosting_ the HTML viewer was still your responsibility. And let\'s be honest, not everybody has the time or expertise to host their own website. So we\'ve added a new feature to SuperSplat to make it easier to share your splats with others.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer muted={true} controls url=\\"/img/supersplat2-publish-1080p-social-60fps.mp4\\" />\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nIt\'s as easy as 1-2-3:\\n\\n1. Log in with your PlayCanvas account (or sign up if you don\'t have one).\\n2. Select `File` > `Publish` when you\'ve finished crafting your splat.\\n3. Fill out the publishing options form and hit `Publish`.\\n\\nThat\'s it! Your splat will be published to the web and you\'ll be given a URL to share with others.\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nBy default, your splat will be listed on the SuperSplat website. However, you can also choose to make it unlisted. This means it won\'t appear in the main gallery, but you can still access it via the URL.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### \ud83c\udfa5 Create Camera Flythroughs\\n\\nSure, it\'s great to be able to share your splats with others, but for that extra \'wow\' factor, why not add a camera flythrough? SuperSplat Editor 2.0 introduces the Timeline that makes it a breeze to author great looking camera animations. Simply select a frame in the timeline, position the camera, and set a keyframe. Do this for as many frames as you want and you\'ve got a camera flythrough!\\n\\n<ReactPlayer muted={true} controls url=\\"/img/supersplat2-camera-animation-720p-social-60fps.mp4\\" />\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcc4 Load and Save your SuperSplat Projects\\n\\nWith the ability to create camera animations, your splat projects are becoming more and more complex. To support this, we\'ve added a new project file format so you can save your work between sessions. The extension of SuperSplat\'s new project file format is `.ssproj`.\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nThe `.ssproj` file format is actually just a ZIP file containing project data in JSON format, along with a set of PLY files storing the Gaussian Splat data.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThe introduction of the new project file format has also prompted us to reorganize the `File` menu. `Open`, `Save` and `Save As` now only operate on `.ssproj` files.

But what if you are a React developer?\\n\\nToday we\'re proud to announce the release of **[PlayCanvas React](https://github.com/playcanvas/react)**, a new declarative way to build 3D content using [React](https://react.dev/).\\n\\n**PlayCanvas React** is a thin React wrapper around the PlayCanvas API. It allows you to build rich 3D content in a declarative way that fully integrates with the React ecosystem. You can create rich, complex 3D content with assets, physics, gaussian splats, audio, and more, all while leveraging the powerful state management of React.\\n\\nCheck out the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/playcanvas-react-mxfvg9?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.jsx) below. Slide open the code editor and play with the code in real time.\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/mxfvg9?view=preview&module=%2Fsrc%2FApp.jsx&hidenavigation=1\\"\\n  style={{ width: \\"100%\\", height: \\"500px\\", border: 0, borderRadius: \\"4px\\", overflow:\\"hidden\\" }}\\n  title=\\"@playcanvas/react\\"\\n  allow=\\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi;   payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\\"\\n  sandbox=\\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\\"\\n  ></iframe>\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### What does this look like?\\n\\nWith **@playcanvas/react** you create a scene using entities and components, just like you would in the PlayCanvas Editor or Engine. Entities have position, rotation and scale. They\'re the building blocks of your scene. Components on the other hand add behavior to an entity. For example, adding a `<Render/>` component to an entity allows it to render a mesh.\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>View code example</summary>\\n\\n  ```jsx\\n  import { Application, Entity } from \'@playcanvas/react\';\\n  import { Script as PcScript } from \'playcanvas\';\\n\\n  // This script spins the entity it\'s attached to\\n  class Spinner extends PcScript {\\n    update(dt) {\\n      this.entity.rotate(0, this.speed * dt, 0)\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  /**\\n   * Your first @playcanvas/react example! \\n   * This renders a spinning box with a camera and some lighting.\\n   */\\n  export const HelloWorld = () => {\\n\\n    const material = useMaterial({ diffuse: \'gray\' })\\n\\n    return <Entity>\\n      {/* Create a camera entity */}\\n      <Entity name=\'camera\' position={[4, 3, 4]}>\\n        <Camera clearColor=\'#111111\' fov={28} />\\n      </Entity>\\n\\n      {/* Create the spinning box entity */}\\n      <Entity position={[0, 0.5, 0]}>\\n        <Render type=\'box\' material={material} />\\n        <Script script={Spinner} speed={10}/>\\n      </Entity>\\n    </Entity>\\n  };\\n\\n  ```\\n\\n</details>\\n\\nIf you\u2019re already familiar with the PlayCanvas API, you\u2019re already off to a good start! You\u2019ll see that any component system available in the engine can be used out of the box including rigid bodies, collision, physics etc. Follow our [Getting Started Guide](https://playcanvas-react.vercel.app/docs/guide/getting-started) and you\'ll be up to speed in no time.\\n\\nIf you\'re coming from a React background, you\'ll find it easy to integrate with existing React projects. Even if you\u2019re new to PlayCanvas, you can pick up the basics in just a few hours.\\n\\n### Why React?\\n\\nReact is loved by developers because it makes building user interfaces simple, intuitive, and predictable. With PlayCanvas React, you can now apply the same magic to 3D! Instead of writing complex, imperative code to create and manage 3D scenes, you can describe them declaratively, just like you do with HTML for a webpage. React\u2019s component-based approach also makes it easy to reuse and organize your 3D content, so you can focus on creativity instead of boilerplate.\\n\\n### What about the Editor and Engine?\\n\\n- The PlayCanvas Engine underpins everything. PlayCanvas React is simply a thin wrapper around the engine with a React friendly syntax. There\'s no strict rule for using one over the other, but if you\'re familiar with React and its ecosystem, you\'ll find PlayCanvas React fits well with your stack.\\n\\n- The Editor on the other hand is a powerful browser-based tool for building rich 3D content. PlayCanvas React is another way of achieving the same goal. Whilst the Editor provides a full suite of tools for asset management, scene organization, and rapid iteration, PlayCanvas React is more about building 3D content from within your React code. If you enjoy a code-centric workflow or want to integrate 3D content directly into a larger React application, PlayCanvas React may be the perfect fit.\\n\\n### Open Source FTW\\n\\nPlayCanvas React is completely open source, licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/playcanvas/react/blob/main/LICENSE). We believe that by sharing our work, collaborating with the community, and encouraging contributions, we aim to build a robust ecosystem.\\n\\nIf you find a bug, have a suggestion, or want to contribute, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/playcanvas/react/issues) or submit a pull request.

We are bubbling with excitement to announce the release of version 2.0.0!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nFor the full details, visit our GitHub:\\n\\n[**RELEASE NOTES**](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/releases/tag/v2.0.0)\\n\\nIt\'s not every day we do a major version bump of the Engine. Let\'s take a walk down memory lane to see how we got here:\\n\\n* October 2010: Coding of the Engine begins!\\n* 24 October 2011: [Engine migrated to GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/commit/e5bf014e738d5bfc92ece1d6c0f50ad71bf4dd90)\\n* 4 June 2014: [Engine goes open source](https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-goes-open-source/)\\n* 24 April 2018: [Engine hits 1.0.0](https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-engine-reaches-1-0-0/)\\n\\nBack in 2018, the Engine was bumped to 1.0.0 because we adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) which dictates:\\n\\n> If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be 1.0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should be 1.0.0. If you\u2019re worrying a lot about backward compatibility, you should probably already be 1.0.0.\\n\\nWith hindsight, the Engine should probably have reached 1.0.0 some years before. It had long been stable and was already being used heavily in production!\\n\\n### Why Bump to 2.0.0\\n\\nSemantic versioning says that you perform a major version bump when you introduce breaking changes. To say we go out of our way to avoid introducing breaking changes in an understatement. But since 1.0.0, we had done 73 minor versions along with countless patch releases. Along the way, the Engine accumulated a considerable amount of \\"cruft\\".\\n\\n:::info[cruft _noun_ `INFORMAL - COMPUTING`]\\n\\nbadly designed, unnecessarily complicated, or unwanted code or software.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nIt was getting to the point where parts of the codebase were restricting our ability to advance the Engine\'s capabilities. And so, we took to the decision to do a spring clean. \ud83e\uddf9 Here are some highlights of what we removed:\\n\\n* **WebGL 1 support.** This is the big one. Today, devices that support WebGL 1 but not WebGL 2 is less than 2% and this number is only going to get smaller. And supporting WebGL 1 was making it extraordinarily difficult to construct the foundations we needed in order to support WebGPU. Cheerio, WebGL 1 - it\'s been fun! \ud83d\udc4b\\n* **Scripts 1.0 support.** The very first `ScriptComponent` implementation was deprecated with the introduction of [Scripts 2.0](https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-scripts-2-0/) back in 2016. So after 8 years of deprecation, it\'s gone! We are now focused on delivering our new ESM-based scripting system, due soon.\\n* **AudioSourceComponent.** This component was the precursor to the Engine\'s [`SoundComponent`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/SoundComponent.html). `AudioSourceComponent` has been deprecated for many years so it\'s time for it to go.\\n* **...and several other public API symbols.** What we are left with is a cleaner, tighter codebase that can power us into the future!\\n\\n### What if my Project Breaks\\n\\nNever fear! Today\'s release is more relevant to \'Engine-only\' users who pull the engine from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playcanvas). At a time of their choosing, these developers can upgrade to 2.0.0 and give it a try. The vast majority of projects will update without modification.\\n\\nEditor users will gain access to Engine 2.0.0 in the coming weeks. At that point, moving to 2.0.0 will be _opt in_ for existing projects. We plan to support the last Engine 1.x release in the Editor for at least a year after Engine 2 becomes available. This should be plenty of time for developers to migrate. New projects will automatically use 2.0.0. We will release more information about the transition for Editor users in the coming weeks.\\n\\nIn the meantime, we ask NPM users to try Engine 2.0.0 and give us your feedback as soon as you can. We hope you like it!

Let\'s check out how it was built.\\n\\n### Step 1: Clean in SuperSplat \ud83e\uddf9\\n\\nAfter [capturing the statues](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/graphics/gaussian-splatting/#creating-splats) to PLY format, our first stop is [SuperSplat](https://playcanvas.com/supersplat/editor?load=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willeastcott/assets/main/statues/narcissus.compressed.ply), the open source tool for editing and optimizing 3D Gaussian Splats. Here, in a little over a minute, we can isolate the statue from the background and align it with the origin:\\n\\n<ReactPlayer muted={true} controls url=\\"/img/statue-supersplat.mp4\\" />\\n\\n<br />\\nOnce we are done, we can download the splat using our [compressed PLY format](https://blog.playcanvas.com/compressing-gaussian-splats). In this case, our downloaded PLY is **only 1.56MB**!\\n\\n### Step 2: Import into the Editor \ud83d\udea7\\n\\nNow that we have a clean, compressed PLY, we simply need to drop it into the Editor\'s Asset Panel. And from there, drag it into the viewport to add it to the scene. Let\'s do that (along with a cube map for a photographic backdrop):\\n\\n<ReactPlayer muted={true} controls url=\\"/img/statue-editor.mp4\\" />\\n\\n<br />\\nThe PlayCanvas Editor is a powerful visual environment for building and publishing 3D scenes. You can:\\n\\n* Grab useful scripts (and other assets) from the Asset Store. Here, we import an Orbit Camera script.\\n* Create beautiful user interfaces, using either HTML or PlayCanvas\' built-in UI system.\\n* Add sound, physics, VR/AR support and much, much more.\\n\\n### Step 3: Add Animation and Post Effects \u2728\\n\\nWhat really makes the demo pop is the transitions that fade the statues in and out.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing={true} muted={true} loop={true} controls url=\\"/img/statue-custom-shaders.mp4\\" />\\n\\n<br />\\nWith the Editor, you can customize the shader code that renders your splats to apply stunning animation effects. For the transition between statues, individual splats are transformed and recolored over time, while a full-screen bloom effect is ramped up and down.\\n\\n### Resources\\n\\nToday\'s release makes working with 3D Gaussian Splats both easy and fun! We\'ve shown you how to build a virtual gallery or museum but the possibilities are endless.

In 2017, we were proud to launch support for [WebGL 2.0](https://blog.playcanvas.com/mozilla-launches-webgl-2-with-playcanvas/) in partnership with our friends at Mozilla. April 2023 marked the beginning of a new era for web graphics when Google enabled WebGPU by default in Chrome 113. Since then, WebGPU adoption has exploded and today, [Web3D Survey](https://web3dsurvey.com/webgpu) reports that **62.19% of end users can now run WebGPU**. With [Firefox and Safari due to launch their WebGPU support](https://caniuse.com/webgpu) in the not-too-distant future, expect this number to rise dramatically in 2024.\\n\\n## Why WebGPU Matters\\n\\nIf you enable WebGPU for your PlayCanvas project, you may not notice much difference to begin with. In fact, we have put a great deal of effort into ensuring your WebGL projects look identical under WebGPU. But over time, there is are a great deal of opportunities to achieve performance improvements due to WebGPU\'s reduced driver overhead.\\n\\nAnother key feature unique to WebGPU is support for Compute Shaders which allow for general computation on the GPU. Support for Compute Shaders landed in [Engine v1.70.0](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/releases/tag/v1.70.0). Here you can see Computer Shaders in action simulating 1 million particles on the GPU:\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FRRFcEiWYEY\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n[Click here](https://playcanvas.github.io/#/compute/particles) to run it for yourself in a WebGPU-enabled browser (i.e. Chrome or Edge).\\n\\nIn short, WebGPU represents the future for PlayCanvas and you can expect some incredible advances in performance and functionality over the coming months.\\n\\n## Getting Started with WebGPU\\n\\nWebGPU support in PlayCanvas is still considered \'Beta\'. There are still some unimplemented features (for example, the run-time lightmapper is still not supported). Therefore, you have to currently \'opt in\' to WebGPU support. To do this, open your Project\'s Settings in the Inspector and expand the `RENDERING` section. Then update `Graphics Devices` to include `WebGPU (beta)`.\\n\\n![Editor with WebGPU Scene](/img/editor-settings-webgpu.png)\\n\\nOnce we are satisfied WebGPU support has matured enough, it will become the default.\\n\\n## Your Feedback is Important\\n\\nSince WebGPU support is new, we rely on the community for feedback. What works and what doesn\'t? Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/playcanvas/editor/issues) if you discover any problems or kick off a new thread on the [forum](https://forum.playcanvas.com/) if you want to discuss WebGPU support in more detail.

The content was written in Markdown and converted to a static HTML site using a tool called [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io/). Customizing the site to our needs meant we had to write many Metalsmith plugins (for localization, navigation and more) and a lot of HTML and CSS to style the pages as we wanted.\\n\\n13 years later, the world of static site generators has moved on with lots of exciting new options! We evaluated [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and decided to migrate over to it.\\n\\n### What\'s New\\n\\nSo what made Docusaurus so compelling? First up, the migration was going to be straightforward because, like Metalsmith, Docusaurus consumes Markdown and outputs a static site. And much of the customization we did for Metalsmith is supplied \'out-of-the-box\' with Docusaurus. So that\'s all great. But the new site comes with lots of cool new features we known you\'re going to love:\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Powerful Search\\n\\nThe site now integrates [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) for advanced searching of the documentation.\\n\\n![Developer Site Search](/img/developer-site-search.png)\\n\\nThis is a quantum leap over what came before. Try it (by pressing `CTRL + K`) - you\'ll be amazed. \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\n#### \ud83c\udf12 Light and Dark Modes\\n\\nEasily switch between light and dark themes (by clicking on the sun/moon icon top-right).\\n\\n![Developer Site Light and Dark Modes](/img/developer-site-light-dark.png)\\n\\n#### \ud83c\udf0f Language Selection\\n\\nSwitch language from the nav-bar. At the moment, we\'re shipping with Japanese translations.\\n\\n![Developer Site Localization](/img/developer-site-localization.png)\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Edit on GitHub\\n\\nAs you might expect, [the Developer Site is Open Source (MIT)](https://github.com/playcanvas/developer.playcanvas.com). Every page now has a handy link to the content on GitHub. Spot a mistake? Now can you fix it yourself and improve the docs for the community!\\n\\n#### \ud83e\udded Easier Navigation\\n\\nAt the top of each page, you\'ll find \'Sidebar Breadcrumbs\' which allow you to click back up the page hierarchy.\\n\\n![Developer Site Breadcrumbs](/img/developer-site-breadcrumbs.png)\\n\\nTo the right of each page, you\'ll find a table of contents which can be a big help, especially for long pages.\\n\\n![Developer Site Table of Contents](/img/developer-site-toc.png)\\n\\nAnd at the bottom of each page, you\'ll find \'Previous\' and \'Next\' links that allow you to read through the User Manual sequentially.\\n\\n![Developer Site Previous and Next Links](/img/developer-site-previous-next.png)\\n\\n## API Reference\\n\\nWe are not just launching a new Developer Site today. We are also launching our brand new, upgraded [API Reference Manual](https://api.playcanvas.com/)!\\n\\n![API Reference Site](/img/api-reference-site.png)\\n\\n### Migrating from JSDoc to TypeDoc\\n\\nSince the start, we have relied on [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) to generate our API reference manual. But since then, we have seen the introduction of [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) which offers some major advantages over JSDoc.\\n\\n#### \ud83c\udfa8 High Quality Default Theme\\n\\nWhile it\'s not perfect, the default TypeDoc theme is gorgeous and a big improvement over our custom JSDoc theme. It provides:\\n\\n* Light and dark modes (like the main developer site)\\n* Links to the source code on GitHub\\n* Grouping of API into related categories\\n* Powerful search (press `/` to activate it)\\n* ...and much more!\\n\\nIt\'s a great foundation for us to begin with and we can customize the default theme to our requirements as needed.\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udd17 Easy Combining of APIs\\n\\nDid you know that PlayCanvas develops frameworks and libraries other than the PlayCanvas Engine? There\'s [PCUI](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui), a front-end framework for web-based tools. There\'s the [PlayCanvas Editor API](https://github.com/playcanvas/editor-api) for automating the interface. And more! The new API reference collects all of the PlayCanvas APIs into a single manual.\\n\\n![API Reference Site APIs](/img/api-reference-site-apis.png)\\n\\n## Open Source FTW\\n\\nEverything we are announcing today is 100% open source.\\n\\n* [Developer Site on GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/developer.playcanvas.com)\\n* [API Reference Site on GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/api-reference)\\n\\nWe want to empower to community to get involved and make PlayCanvas better for everybody.

With gaussian splatting, you can digitize a scene from a few photos using services like [Luma Labs](https://lumalabs.ai/) or [Polycam](https://poly.cam/). These services take the set of photos and generate a 3d Gaussian Splat scene in [PLY format](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)>).\\n\\nFor example, this is a Gaussian Splat scene rendered in PlayCanvas.\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://playcanv.as/p/69cnpevQ/\\" title=\\"360 lookaround camera\\" webkitallowfullscreen=\\"true\\" mozallowfullscreen=\\"true\\" allow=\\"autoplay\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\" allowvr=\\"\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### What is a Splat?\\n\\nGaussian Splat Scenes are not made up of polygons and textures. Instead, they are made up of many (up to millions) of individual, unconnected blobs called _splats_. A splat is just a particle in space with size, orientation, color and opacity.\\n\\nBelow you can see a single brown splat selected. The splat bounding box shows its orientation and size:\\n\\n![Splat Example](/img/splat-example.gif)\\n\\nThe gaussian part of the name comes from the shape of splat itself: the splat opacity has a gaussian falloff from its center to its edge.\\n\\n### Engine Support\\n\\nThe PlayCanvas team has been adding support to the engine for loading and rendering Gaussian Splat PLY files:\\n\\n[![Engine Example](/img/gaussian-splat-example.gif)](https://playcanvas.github.io/#/loaders/splat-many)\\n\\nSince the resulting files are often messy and require cleaning, we released [SuperSplat](https://playcanvas.com/super-splat), a tool for cleaning and processing gaussian splat PLY files:\\n\\n[![SuperSplat Example](/img/super-splat-example.gif)](https://playcanvas.com/super-splat?load=https://code.playcanvas.com/viewer/guitar-cleaned.ply)\\n\\n### PLY Format\\n\\nHowever, the default gaussian splat PLY format as exported by training tools is large.\\n\\nThis is because the uncompressed format stores a large amount of data _per splat_:\\n\\n| Name                        | Data Format | Bytes |\\n| --------------------------- | ----------- | ----- |\\n| Position                    | 3 x float   | 12    |\\n| Orientation                 | 4 x float   | 16    |\\n| Scale                       | 3 x float   | 12    |\\n| Spherical harmonics / color | 48 x float  | 192   |\\n| Total                       |             | 232   |\\n\\nFor example, the original `guitar.ply` scene file takes **132.8 MB** (**32 MB** excluding spherical harmonic data).\\n\\n### Compressed PLY Format\\n\\nSo we introduced a _compressed PLY_ format for use in runtime applications. The compressed PLY file format ignores the unused spherical harmonic data and stores the rest of the elements in quantized integers.\\n\\nThe format can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n- Split the scene into chunks of 256 splats\\n- For each chunk, store the min and max (x, y, z) for position and scale in floating point\\n- For each splat in the chunk, store a normalized and quantized value for position and scale (relative to chunk extents) and orientation and color\\n\\nThis data layout results in the following data _per chunk_:\\n\\n| Name           | Data Format | Bytes |\\n| -------------- | ----------- | ----- |\\n| Position bound | 6 x float   | 24    |\\n| Scale bound    | 6 x float   | 24    |\\n| Total          |             | 48    |\\n\\nAnd the following data _per splat_:\\n\\n| Name        | Data Format            | Bytes |\\n| ----------- | ---------------------- | ----- |\\n| Position    | uint32 (11, 10, 11)    | 4     |\\n| Orientation | uint32 (2, 10, 10, 10) | 4     |\\n| Scale       | uint32 (11, 10, 11)    | 4     |\\n| Color       | uint32 (8, 8, 8, 8)    | 4     |\\n| Total       |                        | 16    |\\n\\nAs a result, the compressed version of `guitar.ply` takes only **8.7 MB**.\\n\\n### Do It Yourself\\n\\nThe easiest way to generate a compressed PLY file yourself is using the [SuperSplat tool](https://playcanvas.com/super-splat). Load the PLY file into SuperSplat and export it again using the \'Compressed Ply File\' option:\\n\\n[![SuperSplat Export](/img/super-splat-export.png)](https://playcanvas.com/super-splat)\\n\\nIf you are interested in the file format specifics, see [this code](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/blob/a86bd8be0cfd4e39e9ba5e5466acb6875ab9906e/extras/splat/splat-data.js#L257) which demonstrates how to decompress the file data.\\n\\nSee [this editor project](https://playcanvas.com/project/1165904/overview/gaussiansplatdemo) for an example of loading and rendering a compressed gaussian splat PLY file. Or you can [run it here](https://playcanv.as/p/69cnpevQ/).\\n\\n### Summary and Future\\n\\nWe have introduced a new compressed PLY format for gaussian splatting which is roughly 4x smaller than uncompressed data and can be used in realtime applications.\\n\\nIn future we hope to:\\n\\n- store splats hierarchically for optimized rendering and culling\\n- implement realtime splat LOD\\n- test skinning and animation of gaussian splats\\n- further compress gaussian splat data\\n- optimize WebGPU rendering\\n\\n### References\\n\\nThe compressed format is largely based on the fine work of Aras Pranckevi\u010dius and his [blog posts](https://aras-p.info/)."},{"id":"avif-webp-land-in-editor","metadata":{"permalink":"/avif-webp-land-in-editor","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2023-10-11-avif-webp-lands-in-editor.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-11-avif-webp-lands-in-editor.md","title":"Boost Your Efficiency: Editor gets Support for AVIF and WebP","description":"AVIF + WebP Support","date":"2023-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"editor","permalink":"/tags/editor"},{"inline":true,"label":"textures","permalink":"/tags/textures"},{"inline":true,"label":"workflow","permalink":"/tags/workflow"},{"inline":true,"label":"compression","permalink":"/tags/compression"}],"readingTime":2.215,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Lundin","title":"Software Engineer","page":{"permalink":"/authors/mark"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/mark_lundin","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marklundin2/","github":"https://github.com/marklundin"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/marklundin.png","key":"mark"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"mark","slug":"avif-webp-land-in-editor","title":"Boost Your Efficiency: Editor gets Support for AVIF and WebP","tags":["editor","textures","workflow","compression"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Compressing Gaussian Splats","permalink":"/compressing-gaussian-splats"},"nextItem":{"title":"glTF Viewer 4.0 Adds WebGPU Support","permalink":"/gltf-viewer-adds-webgpu-support"}},"content":"![AVIF + WebP Support](/img/avif-webp-icons.png)\\n\\n**Today we\'re excited to announce that PlayCanvas now supports WebP and AVIF images natively in the editor. Two new, efficient image formats built for the web.**\\n\\nThis is not just an exciting update for us but a game-changer for anyone looking to optimize their projects for faster load times and better quality.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nJPGs and PNGs have served us well. They\'re reliable and you can use them everywhere. AVIF and WebP are the new kids on the block. They offer better compression with a wider range of features like alpha channels, HDR and wide color gamut. But how do these formats work in practice and are they really that good? Let\'s dive in.\\n\\n_Take a look at the following images:_\\n\\n<iframe\\n  src=\\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/vmg4g3?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&hidedevtools=1\\"\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"100%\\",\\n    height: \\"500px\\",\\n    border: \\"0\\",\\n    borderRadius: \\"4px\\",\\n    overflow: \\"hidden\\"\\n  }}\\n  title=\\"react-compare-image (forked)\\"\\n  allow=\\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\\"\\n  sandbox=\\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\\"\\n></iframe>\\n\\nThey look strikingly similar, but the file size tells a different story. The AVIF image on the left has a file size of just 18Kb, and the JPG counterpart over 4 times larger at 74Kb! This level of compression is not just impressive on its own. When you\'re working on a project with multiple textures, switching to AVIF and WebP formats could considerably reduce your overall load time.\\n\\nWhat does this mean for you? Well, that\'s simple: it\'s all about efficiency and speed without sacrificing quality. Textures are one of the biggest assets in a 3D project and AVIF and WebP significantly reduce image sizes compared to traditional JPEGs and PNGs and that means faster load times and happier users. \ud83d\ude4c\\n\\n#### AVIF all the things?\\n\\nOk, so browser support for AVIF is good, but not great according to [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/?search=avif), so always [check support](https://dev.to/nucliweb/detect-avif-image-support-to-use-in-your-css-4pen) and use the right format for your users. Different formats are better suited for different content. It\'s not a one-size-fits-all solution, so we encourage you to explore various options and choose the one best for you.\\n\\n#### Getting Started\\n\\nEasy! Just start uploading your AVIF and WebP files into the Asset Panel, and for those of you wanting to convert your existing assets, you can now right-click on your asset in the Asset Panel and quickly convert your asset into a PNG, JPG, WebP or an AVIF.\\n\\n![Quick Convert](/img/convert-animation.gif)\\n\\nSo there you have it! This is not just a feature release; it\'s our way of saying we\'re listening and we care. We\'re excited to hear your thoughts on these new features. Give them a try and share your experiences with us.\\n\\nTill then, keep creating, keep innovating!"},{"id":"gltf-viewer-adds-webgpu-support","metadata":{"permalink":"/gltf-viewer-adds-webgpu-support","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2023-10-10-gltf-viewer-adds-webgpu-support.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-10-gltf-viewer-adds-webgpu-support.md","title":"glTF Viewer 4.0 Adds WebGPU Support","description":"We\'re thrilled to announce the launch of the open source glTF Viewer 4.0, an update that supercharges your 3D model viewing experience with powerful features and support for the latest web technologies!","date":"2023-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ar","permalink":"/tags/ar"},{"inline":true,"label":"gltf","permalink":"/tags/gltf"},{"inline":true,"label":"viewer","permalink":"/tags/viewer"},{"inline":true,"label":"webgpu","permalink":"/tags/webgpu"},{"inline":true,"label":"webxr","permalink":"/tags/webxr"}],"readingTime":3.655,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Will Eastcott","title":"CEO","description":"Will Eastcott is an entrepreneur and veteran technologist of the games industry with experience at EA, Sony, and Activision.

Let\'s dive into the headline features of glTF Viewer 4.0.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n#### New WebGPU Renderer\\n\\n![WebGPU Logo](/img/webgpu-logo.svg)\\n\\nTopping the list of today\'s updates is support for WebGPU! WebGPU heralds a new era in graphics and compute capabilities, offering enhanced performance and efficiency. Users can now select WebGPU as their default renderer, and don\'t worry if your platform doesn\'t support it yet - the viewer gracefully falls back to WebGL 2, and subsequently WebGL 1, depending on API availability. Note that WebGPU support is considered beta for the moment and you\'ll need to proactively enable it and refresh the viewer to check it out:\\n\\n[![Enable WebGPU for glTF Viewer](/img/gltf-viewer-webgpu-toggle.gif)](/img/gltf-viewer-webgpu-toggle.gif)\\n\\nAlso make sure you\'re running the viewer in a browser that supports WebGPU. At time of writing, this means Google Chrome!\\n\\n#### Enhanced WebXR AR Mode\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7tV15e4ovzc\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\nTake your 3D models into the real world with our revamped WebXR Augmented Reality (AR) mode! Available currently on Android devices, this enhanced AR mode lets you view any model in your actual environment, complete with intuitive new controls that allow you to accurately position and rotate objects in the real world. Let\'s hope Apple decides to roll out WebXR support on iOS soon! \ud83d\ude4f\\n\\n#### Frame Selected Node\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lCzTRlO2lmo\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\nNavigating large scenes can be a pain - Viewer 4.0 addresses this by allowing you to select a node in the scene via the hierarchy panel on the left. You can then press \'F\' on the keyboard to frame that node and recenter the orbit camera on that node\'s position.\\n\\n#### Better Immersion with Projective Sky Dome\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Upbh-B080MU\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n_[\\"130\\"](https://skfb.ly/6R9Ow) by mononofu is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)._\\n\\nExperience realistic photographic skies with our new projective sky dome! While previous versions allowed for skyboxex with an infinite projection, 4.0 introduces a dome-shaped skybox projection that incorporates a flat ground plane. This warps the skybox texture to have a more believable appearance, delivering a more authentic and immersive perspective, melding your 3D models with strikingly realistic backdrops.\\n\\n#### Debug and Inspect with Render Mode\\n\\n[![glTF Viewer Render Mode](/img/gltf-viewer-render-mode.gif)](/img/gltf-viewer-render-mode.gif)\\n\\nEnsuring that developers can seamlessly troubleshoot and inspect glTF files, the new render mode allows you to select and display individual inputs/outputs of the render pipeline, including albedo, emissive, normals, gloss, AO, and more. This new level of insight is invaluable for debugging, making it even easier to work with your glTF data.\\n\\n#### Enhanced Realism with VSM Shadows\\n\\nThe addition of Variance Shadow Mapping (VSM) casts your 3D scenes in a new light, literally! Shadows aren\'t merely aesthetic; they provide context and depth, especially in AR mode, assisting to ground your object naturally within its real-world environment. Explore scenes with a newfound depth and realism that draws viewers into the experience, both in standard and AR viewing modes. Find the new shadow controls in the Light Settings panel:\\n\\n[![glTF Viewer Light Settings](/img/gltf-viewer-light-settings.png)](/img/gltf-viewer-light-settings.png)\\n\\n### Join Our Open Source Community\\n\\nWe\'re not just excited to share these innovations with you; we\'re eager to hear your thoughts and welcome your contributions!

You can think of it as a sort of \\"YouTube for 3D models\\". The platform hosts millions of 3D models in various formats, including glTF, OBJ, STL, and more.\\n\\nUsers can upload their 3D models to Sketchfab and embed them in other websites much like one would embed a YouTube video. This has made it popular for showcasing 3D models for a wide range of uses including game assets, 3D scans, architectural models, and educational content.\\n\\n### Accessing Sketchfab from the Asset Store\\n\\nEarlier this month, we [announced](https://blog.playcanvas.com/announcing-the-new-playcanvas-asset-store/) the brand new PlayCanvas Asset Store. The Asset Store is an in-Editor panel of useful assets that you can use in your projects. With a few clicks, you can browse, discover and import various types of content. So it is the obvious place to incorporate the vast Sketchfab content library.\\n\\nTo access the Sketchfab library, simply hit the Asset Store button on the Asset Panel header and select the SKETCHFAB filter on the left.\\n\\n[![Open Sketchfab](/img/asset-store-sketchfab-open.gif)](/img/asset-store-sketchfab-open.gif)\\n\\n### Authorizing PlayCanvas to Access Sketchfab\\n\\nIf you want to import models from Sketchfab into PlayCanvas, you first need to create a Sketchfab account. Then, the first time you try to import a Sketchfab model in the Asset Store, you will be asked to authorize PlayCanvas to access your Sketchfab account.\\n\\n[![Authorize Sketchfab](/img/asset-store-sketchfab-authorize.gif)](/img/asset-store-sketchfab-authorize.gif)\\n\\nIt\'s so quick and easy!\\n\\n### New License and Author Info for Assets\\n\\nSketchfab assets are all tagged with a license and an author. When you import Sketchfab content into your PlayCanvas projects, it\'s important that we preserve this information. Now, when you click on any imported asset, you\'ll see we\'ve added links to license and author information in the Inspector panel.\\n\\n[![Sketchfab Licenses](/img/asset-store-sketchfab-license.gif)](/img/asset-store-sketchfab-license.gif)\\n\\nThis ensures that the author\'s licensing wishes are respected and that they recieve credit for their work.\\n\\n### Go Forth and Create\\n\\nWith today\'s release, it\'s never been easier to create interactive 3D experiences for the web. We hope you love the new Sketchfab integration. But, as always, we _love_ to hear your opinions so head over to the [forum](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/playcanvas-integrates-sketchfab/31885) and join the conversation.

Therefore, we thought it might be useful to explain the reasons why we did this and describe the process we followed.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Some History\\n\\nWe originally started our blog back in February 2012 with a very [low-key post](https://blog.playcanvas.com/hello-world/). We installed our own instance of WordPress and that functioned fine for a few years. However, in 2015, we decided that we didn\'t want to deal with managing a WordPress instance ourselves and so we signed up for [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com/), a WordPress hosting service. And there we stayed until today.\\n\\n### A Better Way?\\n\\nOver the years, some frustrations over WordPress did start to materialize. Customizing styling was tricky, bulk editing posts was not an option, managing media through the media library was quite inconvenient, and so on. On top of that, our blog was continuing to grow in popularity and WPEngine costs were rising. A team member suggested Jekyll as an alternative so we ran some tests to see what would be involved in a migration.\\n\\n### Migrating from WordPress to Jekyll\\n\\nFirst up, I should say that you should make use of ChatGPT when you attempt something like this. It made it a smooth and pleasant experience for me. But so you can see how straightforward it was, here are the key steps:\\n\\n1. **Export Your WordPress Content.** On your WordPress Dashboard, navigate to Tools > Export and select \'All Content\'. Click \'Download Export File\'. You should receive an XML file that contains all of your site\u2019s content.\\n2. **Convert WordPress Export to Jekyll Format.** To convert your WordPress export file to a Jekyll-friendly format, you can use a tool called `exitwp`. Here are the steps:\\n\\n    - Clone or download `exitwp` from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp).\\n    - Put your WordPress XML file in the `wordpress-xml` directory in the `exitwp` directory.\\n    - Run `exitwp` (requires Python and some libraries, see the repo\'s `README` for details).\\n    - This will generate a `_posts` directory containing all your blog posts converted into markdown format that Jekyll understands.\\n\\n3. **Setting Up Jekyll.**\\n\\n    - Install Ruby and Jekyll. For installation guide refer to [Jekyll\'s official site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).\\n    - Create a new Jekyll site by typing `jekyll new my-awesome-site` in the command line.\\n    - Replace the `_posts` directory in your new Jekyll site with the `_posts` directory that `exitwp` generated.\\n    - You can run your site locally to see how it looks by using the command `bundle exec jekyll serve`.\\n    - Then, open your browser to http://localhost:4000.\\n\\nOnce I had our blog post content successfully exported to a basic Jekyll site, I checked everything in to a new [GitHub repository](https://github.com/playcanvas/blog). From this point, I wanted any change I made to the content to be tracked via Git version control - I mean, why wouldn\'t you?\\n\\nThe initial migration to Markdown worked OK but it wasn\'t perfect. There was a lot of superfluous whitespace in the generated Markdown and syntax was broken in places. So I took the opportunity to do a wholesale spring clean of the Markdown content.\\n\\n#### Prettier\\n\\n[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is a great code formatter but you may not know that it also has built-in support for Markdown formatting. I installed Prettier via NPM and ran it over all Markdown files:\\n\\n```shell\\nprettier --write _posts\\n```\\n\\nAll formatting was now beautifully consistent.\\n\\n#### Linkinator\\n\\n[Linkinator](https://github.com/JustinBeckwith/linkinator) is a tool for reporting broken hyperlinks in both Markdown and HTML. I scanned the locally generated Jekyll site with it using the following command:\\n\\n```shell\\nlinkinator . --server-root _site --recurse --verbosity error\\n```\\n\\nI fixed well over 100 dead links. The older the post, the more dead links there tended to be (as you might expect). While I was always able to use Linkinator on the published WordPress site, it was never convenient to skip from post to post and edit hyperlinks in the WordPress UI (we have over 220 posts). So I never made the time for it. Now I was able to quickly search and replace links in Visual Studio Code and it was a breeze.\\n\\nAside from giving your readers a better experience, here\'s what ChatGPT has to say about dead links:\\n\\n> While Google\'s algorithms are complex and multifaceted, it is generally understood that having too many broken or dead links on your site can negatively affect your website\'s SEO ranking, albeit indirectly.\\n\\nSo this step was definitely worth doing!\\n\\n#### Media Library\\n\\nEvery WordPress blog has a Media Library that contains all of the images and videos referenced by your posts. The PlayCanvas Media Library had over 1GB of content. However, I noticed that a large amount of content was not actually referenced by any post. I wanted to ensure that I exported only the _used_ media (since I didn\'t want to bloat the GitHub repository).\\n\\n- **Step 1:** Install WordPress plugin [Media Cleaner](https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-cleaner/) and use it to delete unused media files.\\n- **Step 2:** Install WordPress plugin [Export Media Library](https://wordpress.org/plugins/export-media-library/) to download all remaining media files in a ZIP.\\n\\nThis process cut the Media Library from 1GB to about 550MB. I simply extracted the ZIP contents to `assets/media` (relative to the root folder of my Jekyll site) and then did a search and replace of all media embed links to use the new file location. Easy!\\n\\n### Hosting on GitHub Pages\\n\\nI now had a fully exported and functional Jekyll blog. But where to host it? One option was to throw the static site onto a file server and put it behind a CDN. But wait, the file-set of the Jekyll blog now sits in GitHub, so why not use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the site? There are some great benefits:\\n\\n- Deployment is a breeze to set up.\\n- It\'s a managed platform so you just don\'t need to worry about maintenance and security as you would with your own infra.\\n- And, oh yeah, **it\'s free!**\\n\\n### The Pros and Cons\\n\\nSo now that we\'re migrated over, let\'s quickly summarize the key benefits:\\n\\n- **Free:** Costs for our blog are now a pleasing $0.\\n- **Secure:** We have eliminated a potential attack vector. No more password reset confirmation emails!\\n- **Powerful Tooling:** There\'s a vast array of free and open source tools to lint and format Markdown.\\n- **Easy Editing:** Choose any editor you like such as the awesome Visual Studio Code.\\n- **Versioned:** All content is now under version control providing revision history, diffing and so on.\\n- **Collaborative:** We can take contributions to the blog via GitHub\'s pull request mechanism.\\n- **Customizable:** We have fine-grain control over the HTML and styling of posts using Jekyll themes.\\n- **Platform Agnostic:** Markdown makes it trivial to migrate to any other platform in the future.\\n\\nOK, but what about the cons? \ud83e\udd14 I have to tell you - I genuinely can\'t think of any! Sure, we don\'t have comments enabled now but as I understand it, Disqus has a [Jekyll integration](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1935528-jekyll-installation-instructions) that we can turn on at some point. Seriously, feel free to ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/willeastcott/) if you think I\'m missing something here. But I wish we had taken this step years ago.\\n\\n### Open Source and Open to Contributions\\n\\nAs mentioned, the blog is now on [GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/blog). Take a moment to go check out the repository and hit that Star button if you like what we\'ve done here. \u2b50 We\'ve taken the step to open source the blog\'s content under an [Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International](https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/blob/main/LICENSE.md) license. This is part of our continuing drive to open source most of what we do.\\n\\nUltimately, we want **you** to get involved and help us make the blog better and better over time. Consider submitting issues and pull requests yourself.\\n\\n- Submit spelling and grammar fixes.\\n- Submit design tweaks and improvements.\\n- Submit your own posts showcasing your PlayCanvas projects.\\n\\nIt\'s your blog! \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nThat\'s all from me.

And _not one single line of code is needed_!\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RtIhB2Orqa4\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\nNow, let\'s examine some of the key highlights that make the new Asset Store so special.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Built Right In To The Editor\\n\\nIt should be possible to grab assets quickly, right from within the Editor itself. Why should you have to open a new tab and go hunting around the web? So to keep things as convenient as possible, the ASSET STORE button (in the Editor\'s Assets Panel) now opens a nicely designed, responsive Asset Store panel.\\n\\n[![Asset Store Panel](/img/asset-store-open.gif)](/img/asset-store-open.gif)\\n\\nOne really cool benefit of selecting assets from within the Editor is that the currently selected Asset folder is known. This means you have compete control over where your imported assets will be saved.\\n\\n### Preview Store Assets Before Import\\n\\nSometimes, an asset thumbnail just isn\'t sufficient to tell if a particular asset is what you want.\\n\\n[![Asset Store Viewer](/img/asset-store-viewer.gif)](/img/asset-store-viewer.gif)\\n\\nOur new Store allows you to select a Store Item and preview it in an appropriate viewer (glTF Viewer for 3D models, Texture Viewer for textures and cubemaps).\\n\\n### Find What You Want Quickly\\n\\nAs the number of store items continues to grow, it\'s going to be incredibly important for you to be able to narrow down your assets searches. As a result, the new Store comes with powerful searching, sorting and filtering capabilities.\\n\\n[![Asset Store Search](/img/asset-store-search.gif)](/img/asset-store-search.gif)\\n\\nYou can filter by asset type, search asset names and descriptions and then order search results on a host of criteria.\\n\\n### Fresh New Content\\n\\nRecently, the Asset Store content was, let\'s just say, beginning to show its age. We are now in a world of HDR skyboxes, PBR materials and high polygon meshes. So it made sense to erase old store items and refresh the Store with better, more modern content. We have selected a broad variety of Creative Commons assets from fantastic content sources such as [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/), [HDRi Haven](https://hdri-haven.com/), [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) and Khronos\' [glTF Sample Models](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models).\\n\\n[![Asset Store Content](/img/asset-store-content.gif)](/img/asset-store-content.gif)\\n\\nIf you would have any suggestions for content you would like to be added to the Store, please do let us know!\\n\\n### The Future\\n\\nThere\'s still so much we want to do with the new Asset Store! But here are some things we have in mind:\\n\\n1. **More Content.** The important thing to say about today\'s update is that it delivers the core infrastructure on which we can iterate. It is now exceptionally easy for us to populate the store with more content. So, in the near term, you can expect to see the range of content expand quite rapidly.\\n\\n2. **Third Party Stores.** Now that we have a solid foundation in place for the Store, we have the ability to host third party stores within the same UI and maximize your choice.\\n\\n3. **More Asset Types.** Today\'s launch offers models, fonts, textures, skyboxes and scripts. Next, we want to add audio assets and template assets (AKA prefabs). Template assets in particular are very exciting because you would be able to import fully interactive, visual entities into your projects (such as a drivable vehicle or a controllable character).\\n\\nWhat would _you_ like to see us add to the Asset Store next?

As the successor to WebGL, WebGPU provides faster and more efficient rendering capabilities for complex 3D graphics and simulations.\\n\\nPlayCanvas has been at the forefront of this new technology and has been working on adding WebGPU support to its platform.\\n\\nWith WebGPU, we can expect to see more immersive and interactive 3D experiences on the web in the future.\\n\\n[![WebGPU Area Lights](/img/webgpu-area-lights-demo.jpg)](/img/webgpu-area-lights-demo.jpg)  \\n[_PlayCanvas WebGPU Clustered Area Lights Demo_](https://playcanvas.com/demos/arealights/)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Refactoring of WebGL engine\\n\\nBefore adding support for WebGPU, it\'s important to discuss the significant amount of refactoring work that was required on our existing WebGL engine. Implementing deeper architectural changes while preserving backwards compatibility required a significant amount of meticulous care.\\n\\n- To enable support for WebGPU, we needed to establish a clear separation of graphics technology that could be shared between WebGL and WebGPU. This involved a significant refactoring effort to extract WebGL-specific code into a separate set of classes.\\n- PlayCanvas utilizes a collection of shader chunks to produce GLSL shaders that implement advanced material properties and lighting modes, as well as custom shader chunks defined by users. However, since WebGPU employs the WGSL language, we used glslang and tint WASM modules to dynamically convert these shaders on-the-fly with injecting support for uniform buffers and other modifications.\\n- The PlayCanvas engine lacked explicit render passes, making the rendering process more rigid and harder to extend. This was solved by implementing a FrameGraph that allowed us to describe the rendering process as a set of render passes, their dependencies, and associated targets, which created a more flexible and performant rendering architecture.\\n- Unlike WebGL, which sets render state and shaders using a custom API, WebGPU specifies all those through render pipelines. To support both rendering APIs with optimal performance, we needed to refactor the render states into standalone objects that are efficient to compare and set up.\\n- To support the WebGPU platform, we need to undergo a significant refactoring to organize uniforms into uniform buffers.\\n- To facilitate the asynchronous creation of WebGPU device, we have introduced a new async API to create a graphics device, which is the primary breaking change required to adopt WebGPU.\\n\\n## What is left to do\\n\\n- Our primary objective is to align the WebGPU implementation with that of WebGL, and while we have made significant progress towards this goal, there are still some features that are missing. Furthermore, several smaller details require cleanup and rectification.\\n- We need to incorporate it into the Editor environment for both launched and published applications. Currently, only WebGL is available in this environment.\\n- Our primary objective is to achieve full parity with WebGL, but initially, we are focusing on basic implementations of some concepts to deliver a working implementation, which will need to be extended to meet our performance objectives.\\n- WebGPU provides developers with access to Compute Shaders, which enables more efficient parallel processing of data on the GPU. This feature can significantly improve the performance of complex algorithms and simulations, which may have been impractical to run on the CPU. With access to Compute Shaders, we can bring new visual features to the next level, such as advanced particle systems, post-processing and global illumination techniques.\\n\\n## Engine examples\\n\\nAs an early pre-release of WebGPU, we have updated several engine examples to use it, which can be accessed on [https://playcanvas.github.io](https://playcanvas.github.io/). To use WebGPU, the Chrome Canary browser is required, with the \'chrome://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu\' flag enabled.\\n\\n[![Examples Browser WebGPU](/img/playcanvas-examples-browser-webgpu.jpg)](/img/playcanvas-examples-browser-webgpu.jpg)\\n\\n[PlayCanvas Examples Browser](https://playcanvas.github.io/)\\n\\nLet us know what you think in the [forums](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/engine-release-v1-62/30360)!\\n\\n### Attributions\\n\\n[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Sedan \'71](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/oldsmobile-cutlass-supreme-sedan-71-78f76d386a4341b0b71745bdc50fd5ab) by Barbo is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)"},{"id":"webxr-ar-made-easy-with-playcanvas","metadata":{"permalink":"/webxr-ar-made-easy-with-playcanvas","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2023-03-16-webxr-ar-made-easy-with-playcanvas.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-16-webxr-ar-made-easy-with-playcanvas.md","title":"WebXR AR Made Easy with PlayCanvas","description":"We are excited to announce the launch of our WebXR AR Starter Kit, available in the New Project dialog today!","date":"2023-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ar","permalink":"/tags/ar"},{"inline":true,"label":"webxr","permalink":"/tags/webxr"}],"readingTime":0.815,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Yau","title":"Partner Relations Manager","page":{"permalink":"/authors/steven"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/yaustar","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenyau/","github":"https://github.com/yaustar"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/yaustar.png","key":"steven"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"steven","slug":"webxr-ar-made-easy-with-playcanvas","title":"WebXR AR Made Easy with PlayCanvas","tags":["ar","webxr"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Initial WebGPU support lands in PlayCanvas Engine 1.62!","permalink":"/initial-webgpu-support-lands-in-playcanvas-engine-1-62"},"nextItem":{"title":"Draco Mesh Compression Arrives in the PlayCanvas Editor","permalink":"/draco-mesh-compression-arrives-in-the-playcanvas-editor"}},"content":"We are excited to announce the launch of our WebXR AR Starter Kit, available in the New Project dialog today!\\n\\n[![New Project WebXR](/img/webar-xr-starterkit-project-dialog.jpg)](/img/webar-xr-starterkit-project-dialog.jpg)\\n\\n[WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev/) is a technology that powers immersive and interactive AR and VR experiences to be accessed through supported web browsers.

The technology achieves this by applying a lossy compression algorithm to the mesh data. With less data to transfer, the result is faster load times and lower bandwidth costs for your applications.\\n\\nThe open source [PlayCanvas Engine](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine) has been able to load Draco-compressed glTF 2.0 files for quite some time now. But now you can generate these Draco-compressed glTF files in the Editor at import time.

That\'s a **92.6% reduction is file size**! And for the majority of scenes, you should notice _no difference in terms of visual quality_. The only cost is decompression time when the compressed GLB is downloaded by an end user, but this should be significantly less than what is saved in terms of download time.\\n\\nTo enable the feature, open your Project Settings in the Inspector, expand the Asset Tasks panel and edit the Mesh Compression setting. Then, simply Re-Import any existing FBX or GLB and compression will be applied. Any FBX or GLB subsequently imported will also respect your mesh compression setting.

It\'s the attention to detail and the finishing touches that can make a good game great. In this article, we\'ll take a look at the importance of polish in game development and how it can significantly enhance the overall experience.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWe\'ll use [Space Rocks!](https://playcanvas.com/project/1029772/overview/space-rocks), a simple Asteroids game created with the PlayCanvas game engine to showcase how even the smallest details can make a big impact.\\n\\n> [Game juice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg) is a design term to refer to the small visual and audio effects that are added to a game to make it feel more satisfying to play. This can include things like screen shakes, particle effects, and sound effects that are triggered when the player takes certain actions. Game juice is all about enhancing the overall feel of a game and making it more immersive and enjoyable.\\n\\nParticularly, we\'ll explore how game polish can be achieved through **game juice**.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/Space-Rocks-before-and-after-v2-60fps.mp4\\" />\\n\\n[Play it here!](https://playcanvas.com/project/1014332/overview/space-rocks)\\n\\n## How it started\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/Space-Rocks-How-it-started-1.mp4\\" />\\n\\nThis was our starting point before we added game juice. While the game is fully functional and plays well, it lacks the visual and audio effects that would make it truly engaging. As a result, it feels a bit dull and uninteresting.\\n\\nHowever, with the right attention to detail and some careful implementation of game juice, we can transform this basic Asteroids game into something much more exciting and satisfying to play.\\n\\n## What can we improve?\\n\\nTo think about what should have game juice, I always try to narrow down the most common interaction or core mechanic of the game. In our case, that would probably be:\\n\\n- Shooting\\n- Destroying asteroids\\n- Colliding with asteroids\\n\\nWith those three key pieces in mind, let\'s start thinking about how we can improve them.\\n\\n## For shooting\\n\\nIt\'s not very interesting right now:\\n\\n![Basic Shooting](/img/Space-Rocks-image9.gif)\\n\\nIf we want to change that, there\'s a few key things we can do. We can increase the fire rate through a script that allows us to easily control by decreasing the fire cooldown.\\n\\n```javascript\\nGun.attributes.add(\'cooldown\', {\\n    type: \'number\',\\n    default: 0.25,\\n    title: \'Cooldown\',\\n    description: \'How long the gun has to wait between firing each bullet\'\\n});\\n\\nGun.prototype.update = function (dt) {\\n    this._cooldownTimer -= dt;\\n\\n    if (this.app.mouse.isPressed(pc.MOUSEBUTTON_LEFT) && this.canFire()) {\\n        this.fireBullet();\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn fact, while we\'re at it, let\'s make shooting a bit more unpredictable. Let\'s add some spread to our shots!\\n\\n```javascript\\nGun.attributes.add(\'spread\', {\\n    type: \'number\',\\n    default: 10,\\n    title: \'Bullet Spread\',\\n    description: \'Up to how many degrees each bullet should vary in Y rotation.\'\\n});\\n\\nGun.prototype.applySpreadOn = function (bullet) {\\n    var rotation = this.entity.getEulerAngles();\\n    rotation.y += getRandomDeviation(this.spread);\\n    bullet.setEulerAngles(rotation);\\n};\\n```\\n\\nA simple but impactful change! Here\'s how it looks with values I put in for some fun:\\n\\n![Shooting Spread Effect](/img/Space-Rocks-image7.gif)\\n\\nI highly encourage you to play with these values to see what\'s fun for you!\\n\\nIt\'s getting better, but still not there. Let\'s think about more visual aspects now. What more can we do to make it more visually appealing?\\n\\nPlayCanvas has a nice feature that allows you to have tons of lights in your scene with very little performance impact! It\'s called \u2728 Clustered Lighting \u2728.\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\"twitter-tweet\\"><p lang=\\"en\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">Clustered area lights are happening at <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/playcanvas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\\">@playcanvas</a> ! <a href=\\"https://t.co/LTwlhbcg8y\\">pic.twitter.com/LTwlhbcg8y</a></p>&mdash; Martin Valigursky (@ValigurskyM) <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/ValigurskyM/status/1458769117914312707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\\">November 11, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\" charset=\\"utf-8\\"><\/script>\\n\\nWe can actually leverage this amazing tech to give every single one of our bullets a point light - this makes the scene considerably more dynamic as everything gets lit up when we fire!\\n\\nAs another touch, let\'s add a few sparkles when our shots hit something! The extra visual effect will make a big difference instead of just letting our bullets disappear. Particle explosions are always awesome.\\n\\n![Shooting With Particles](/img/Space-Rocks-image3.gif)\\n\\nAwesome! Our bullets look pretty nice. But we\u2019re still shooting at fairly dull asteroids. Let\'s make a few changes.\\n\\n## Destroying Asteroids\\n\\nFirstly, we want our asteroids to stand out from our background. Let\'s change the background texture to something a bit brighter.\\n\\n![New Background Texture](/img/MakeYourHTML5GamesAwesome-2.png)\\n\\nMuch better! But can we make the asteroids themselves prettier? They\'re currently mapped with a fairly low resolution texture. Moreover, there\'s no variety - all asteroids are the same, only rotated differently.\\n\\nLet\'s import a new mesh and texture for the asteroids.\\n\\n![New Asteroid Model](/img/MakeYourHTML5GamesAwesome-3.png)\\n\\nNice! Much more visible, and much more variety - I should note I went ahead and added a simple component that further randomizes the scale of the asteroids being spawned!\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar ScaleRandomizer = pc.createScript(\'scaleRandomizer\');\\n\\nScaleRandomizer.attributes.add(\'baseScale\', {\\n    type: \'number\',\\n    title: \'Base Scale\',\\n    description: \'The base scale to deviate from\'\\n});\\n\\nScaleRandomizer.attributes.add(\'scaleDeviation\', {\\n    type: \'number\',\\n    title: \'Scale Deviation\',\\n    description: \'The amount by which the effective scale should deviate from the base scale\'\\n});\\n\\n// initialize code called once per entity\\nScaleRandomizer.prototype.initialize = function () {\\n    this.entity.setLocalScale(this.getRandomScale());\\n};\\n\\nScaleRandomizer.prototype.getRandomScale = function () {\\n    var deviation = getRandomFloatDeviation(this.scaleDeviation, 3);\\n    var randomScale = this.baseScale + deviation;\\n\\n    return new pc.Vec3(randomScale, randomScale, randomScale);\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAwesome, the asteroids look much nicer. Let\'s turn our attention back to our background for a moment as it looks very static.\\n\\n- Could we give it some life by adding some \u2018background\u2019 asteroids?\\n- Could we even make destroyed asteroids leave pieces behind as we destroy them?\\n- The game currently gets harder as time goes on. Maybe we can indicate that visually somehow? Maybe by changing the background texture?\\n\\nLet\'s implement these ideas!\\n\\nFor the background asteroids, I simply reused our asteroid spawner class, but moved the spawn points a bit below.\\n\\n![Spawner Script UI](/img/MakeYourHTML5GamesAwesome-4.png)\\n\\nTo make it as non-impactful on performance as possible, I duplicated our template, renamed it to FakeAsteroid and removed all components, except the Mover and Rotator components.\\n\\n> This is one of the beauties of using a component-based architecture! It allows you to quickly alter the behavior of objects without having to write or modify code at all!\\n\\nI also made the FakeAsteroid texture much darker, so as not to distract or confuse the player.\\n\\nMy approach to the \u2018fragment\u2019 asteroids was similar, except I made them much smaller, and gave the regular asteroids a component to spawn fragments on death.\\n\\n```javascript\\nFragmentSpawner.attributes.add(\'minMaxCount\', {\\n    type: \'vec2\',\\n    title: \'Min, Max Count\',\\n    description: \'The minimum and maximum amount of fragments to spawn.\'\\n});\\n\\nFragmentSpawner.prototype.spawnFragments = function () {\\n    if (FragmentSpawner.fragmentParent === null) {\\n        return;\\n    }\\n\\n    var spawnCount = getRandomInRange(this.minMaxCount.x, this.minMaxCount.y);\\n\\n    for (i = 0; i < spawnCount; i++) {\\n        this.spawnSingleFragment();\\n    }\\n};\\n\\nFragmentSpawner.prototype.spawnSingleFragment = function () {\\n    var fragment = this.fragmentTemplate.resource.instantiate();\\n    fragment.reparent(FragmentSpawner.fragmentParent);\\n    var position = this.getFragmentPosition();\\n    fragment.setPosition(position);\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAnd, while we\u2019re at it, why don\'t we add a dust puff and small particles when the asteroid gets destroyed to complement our fragments?\\n\\nI gathered a few textures online, duplicated our bullet hit particle effects and modified them. To spawn the particle effects, I used the same component I had used in the bullet:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// A script that spawns a particle effect on death\\nvar DeathEffect = pc.createScript(\'deathEffect\');\\n\\nDeathEffect.attributes.add(\'particleEffects\', {\\n    type: \'asset\',\\n    assetType: \'template\',\\n    array: true,\\n    title: \'Particle Effect Templates\',\\n});\\n\\nDeathEffect.effectParent = null;\\n\\n// initialize code called once per entity\\nDeathEffect.prototype.initialize = function () {\\n    this.entity.on(\'destroy\', this.onDestroy, this);\\n\\n    if (!DeathEffect.effectParent) {\\n        DeathEffect.effectParent = this.entity.parent;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\nDeathEffect.prototype.onDestroy = function () {\\n    for (var i = 0; i < this.particleEffects.length; i++) {\\n        var effect = this.particleEffects[i].resource.instantiate();\\n        effect.setPosition(this.entity.getPosition());\\n        effect.reparent(effectParent);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAnd lastly for the background, I added a script to lerp the transparency of our blue space material towards 0. This slowly reveals a purple material underneath.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// A script that manages ambient color.\\nvar AmbientManager = pc.createScript(\'ambientManager\');\\n\\nAmbientManager.attributes.add(\'startingColor\', {\\n    type: \'rgba\',\\n    title: \'Starting Color\',\\n    description: \'The starting color for the ambient\'\\n});\\n\\nAmbientManager.attributes.add(\'finalColor\', {\\n    type: \'rgba\',\\n    title: \'Final Color\',\\n    description: \'The final color for the ambient\'\\n});\\n\\nAmbientManager.attributes.add(\'targetMaterial\', {\\n    type: \'asset\',\\n    assetType: \'material\',\\n    title: \'Target Material\',\\n    description: \'The material whose color to set (Matching the ambient color)\'\\n});\\n\\n// initialize code called once per entity\\nAmbientManager.prototype.initialize = function () {\\n    this.updateTransition(0);\\n};\\n\\nAmbientManager.prototype.updateTransition = function (transitionProgress) {\\n    var color = new pc.Color();\\n    color.lerp(this.startingColor, this.finalColor, transitionProgress);\\n\\n    var mat = this.targetMaterial.resource;\\n    mat.emissive = color;\\n    mat.opacity = color.a;\\n    mat.update();\\n};\\n```\\n\\nHere\'s the end result with all of our asteroid changes:\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/Space-Rocks-After.mp4\\" />\\n\\nIt looks amazingly better! Already a massive difference from our starting point.\\n\\n## Colliding With Asteroids\\n\\nThe last piece of the puzzle is when asteroids hit us! It needs to feel impactful! As if you were in a car, and the car just went over a bump.\\n\\nWe\'ll want to communicate it a bit better. Right now, all that happens is that the \u2018n lives left\u2019 counter in the top left gets decremented. Not only does it need to be obvious that we\'ve got hit, but the player must be able to consult how many lives left he has at a glance.\\n\\nI downloaded the model for our spaceship, and made a top-down render of it in Blender. The result was a simple plain icon:\\n\\n![Spaceship Icon](/img/MakeYourHTML5GamesAwesome-6.png)\\n\\nPlain, but enough to make a health counter with. Let\'s make it semi transparent and add it to the world. Our health counter will display from one to three of these icons to indicate how much life we\'ve got left.\\n\\nTo give it some more juice, let\'s also make it \u2018jump up\u2019 when our health changes, and rotate it inwards towards the game world, to give it a 3D appearance.\\n\\nAnd, since using components makes it easy, let\'s do the same to our score counter:\\n\\n![Score Counter](/img/MakeYourHTML5GamesAwesome-7.png)\\n\\nMuch simpler, and much nicer!\\n\\nNext up, let\'s try to emulate that \u2018bump\u2019 feeling. We can do this by adding some screen shake whenever we get hit! And for extra impact, we can make it slow-mo as well!\\n\\nMaking it slow mo is fairly simple - one component does it:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar BulletTimeEffect = pc.createScript(\'bulletTimeEffect\');\\n\\nBulletTimeEffect.attributes.add(\'effectDuration\', {\\n    type: \'number\',\\n    default: 1,\\n    title: \'Effect Duration\',\\n    description: \'How long the bullet time effect should last.\'\\n});\\n\\nBulletTimeEffect.attributes.add(\'timeCurve\', {\\n    type: \'curve\',\\n    title: \'Time Curve\',\\n    description: \'How much the time scale should be over unscaled time.\'\\n});\\n\\n// initialize code called once per entity\\nBulletTimeEffect.prototype.initialize = function () {\\n    this._time = 0;\\n    this.entity.on(\'destroy\', function () {\\n        this.app.timeScale = 1;\\n    }, this);\\n};\\n\\n// update code called every frame\\nBulletTimeEffect.prototype.update = function (dt) {\\n    this._time += (dt / this.app.timeScale) / this.effectDuration;\\n    this.app.timeScale = this.timeCurve.value(this._time);\\n    this.app.timeScale = Math.min(1, this.app.timeScale);\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAs for making the screen shake, it\'s a bit more complex (though certainly not magic!). The underlying logic is to simply move the camera randomly. To do so, we can use a script that tracks the camera\'s original position, and translates it randomly. We reset to the original position at the beginning of each new frame, and repeat.\\n\\n```javascript\\nthis.entity.setPosition(originalPosition);\\nthis.entity.translate(this.getRandomTranslation());\\n```\\n\\nThe above getRandomTranslation() method could simply return a random Vector3, and it would work. Problem is, though, this approach can make the camera feel like it is jittering, not shaking, particularly if the shake distance is large. This can cause motion sickness.\\n\\nWhat else can we do then? Well, there is a more mathematically complex way of getting a random number - one that makes it so that our shaking is smooth, not jittery. This way of getting a random number is Perlin Noise!\\n\\nPerlin Noise is used to create awesome things all over media, from explosion visual effects to Minecraft\'s world generation. If you\'re interested in the math or simply curious, you can learn more in [this](https://adrianb.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html) excellent article.\\n\\nLet\'s go with Perlin Noise for our game. You can see the implementation we went with in the [perlin-camera-shake.js](https://playcanvas.com/editor/code/1029772?tabs=118417182) and [perlin-noise.js](https://playcanvas.com/editor/code/1029772?tabs=118417125) script.\\n\\nLastly, let\'s add a small shockwave whenever we get hit! Let\'s use a particle system for this - just like with the asteroid explosion and bullet hit effects. I grabbed a simple circular texture, coloured it red to indicate something negative, and added a script that spawns the effect whenever the player gets hit.\\n\\nThe combined effects look like this:\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/Space-Rocks-Preview.mp4\\" />\\n\\nYou\'ll notice I\'ve added screen shake to more than just the player getting hit! I\'m a big fan of this effect, so I\'ve added it to asteroid explosions and firing bullets as well!\\n\\n## And that about does it\\n\\nWith the effects we added above, the game looks and plays entirely different. Destroying asteroids **feels** good, and everything else in the game is there to enhance that experience.\\n\\n![Finished Game](/img/MakeYourHTML5GamesAwesome-9.png)\\n\\nAs a last finishing touch, I went ahead and added a few post-processing effects that PlayCanvas offers. Namely, Vignette, Bloom and Chromatic Aberration. I also added CRT Scanlines as an overlay for a retro effect.\\n\\nI hope this guide has been useful to you! Take a look at the project, it is public and is accessible as a [Game Demo in our documentation](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/space-rocks/).\\n\\nPlayCanvas is an excellent cloud-based game engine that allows you to build games for the browser.

Your audiences can interact with your holograms in augmented reality, virtual reality and on 2D screens.\\n\\nThey are experts at capturing holographic video, advancing capture technology and have been pioneering its applications since 2010.\\n\\n[Learn more about Microsoft Mixed Reality Capture Studios here](https://microsoft.com/mrcs).\\n\\n### How was this created?\\n\\nThe demo was created with a combination of several tutorials and kits available on the [PlayCanvas Developer Site](https://developer.playcanvas.com/), the MRCS playback library and freely available online assets.\\n\\nYou can find the public project for the demo [here](https://playcanvas.com/project/988340/overview/ms-mrcs-holo-video-private). We\'ve removed the URL to the volumetric video file (due to distribution rights) and the proprietary MRCS devkit library. Please [contact MRCS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mixed-reality/capture-studios#primaryR8) to gain access to the library and example videos.\\n\\n#### Microsoft Video Playback Library\\n\\nIn the folder \'holo video\', you will find the scripts and assets needed for playing back volumetric video. You will need to add the devkit library file name \'holo-video-object-umd.js\' that will be provided from MRCS to complete the integration and be able to playback video.\\n\\n[![Holo Video In Assets Panel](/img/holo-video-folder.png)](/img/holo-video-folder.png)\\n\\nDue to the size and how the data files for the video need to be arranged, they have to be hosted on a separate web server (ideally behind a CDN service like [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/cdn/)).\\n\\nThe \'holo-video-player.js\' script can be added to any Entity and be given a URL to the .hcap file. At runtime, the script will create the necessary meshes, materials, etc to render and playback the volumetric video.\\n\\n[![Holo Video Script UI](/img/holo-video-player-script-inspector.png)](/img/holo-video-player-script-inspector.png)\\n\\nExpect full documentation to be released soon on our site!\\n\\n#### Creating a Multi Platform AR and VR experience\\n\\nAs you see in the video, we\'ve made the experience available to view in the standard browser, AR on WebXR-enabled mobile devices (Android) and VR on devices like the Oculus Quest. iOS support for WebXR is in progress by the [WebKit team](https://webkit.org/status/#specification-webxr).\\n\\nThis was done by combining several of our WebXR example projects and the scripts and assets can be found in the \'webxr\' folder:\\n\\n[![WebXR Folder In Assets Panel](/img/webxr-folder.png)](/img/webxr-folder.png)\\n\\n\'xr-manger.js\' is controls how the XR experience is managed and handled throughout the experience:\\n\\n- Entering and leaving AR and VR.\\n- Which UI buttons to show based on the XR capabilities of the device it is running on (e.g hides the VR UI button if AR is available or VR is not available).\\n- Showing and hiding Entities that are specific to each experience.\\n- Moving specific Entities in front of the user when in AR so the video can be seen more easily without moving.\\n\\n#### Adding AR\\n\\nAR mode was added first, taking the \'xr-manager.js\' script as a base from [WebXR UI Interaction tutorial](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/webxr-ray-input/). Key changes that had to be made to the project were:\\n\\n- Ensuring \u2018Transparent Canvas\u2019 is enabled in the project rendering settings.\\n- Creating a second camera specifically for AR which is set to render the layers that are needed for AR (i.e. not including the skybox layer) and having a transparent clear color for video passthrough).\\n\\nAfter [copying and pasting](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/designer/assets/#copy-and-paste-between-projects) \'the xr-manager.js\' file from the tutorial project into the demo project, I hooked up the UI elements and buttons to enter AR and added extra functionality to disable and enable Entities for AR and non-AR experiences.\\n\\nThis was handled by adding tags to those Entities that the manager finds and disables/enables when the user starts and exits the XR experiences.\\n\\nFor example, I only want the AR playback controls entity to be available in AR so the tag \'ar\' was added to it.\\n\\n[![Entity Tagged With AR](/img/entity-ar-tag.png)](/img/entity-ar-tag.png)\\n\\nThere is also an additional tag \'ar-relative\' that is used for entities that need to [move in front of the user](https://playcanvas.com/editor/code/988340?tabs=103708151&line=161) when the floor is found in AR. It provides a much better experience for the user as they don\'t have to move or look around to find the content.\\n\\nWhen the user leaves the AR session, the Entities are [moved back to their original position](https://playcanvas.com/editor/code/988340?tabs=103708151&line=99) that were saved when they entered.\\n\\n#### Adding VR\\n\\nThis was a little trickier than expected as we didn\'t have a complete example of the needed functionality and it also had to work with the existing AR functionality.\\n\\nThe goal was for the user to be able to move around holo video and also show the controllers that matched the VR input devices being used.\\n\\nOur [Starter Kit: VR](https://playcanvas.com/project/435780/overview/starter-kit-vr) has the scripts and functionality to interact with objects, teleport and move around an environment. We can tag entities in the scene with \'pickable\' for the VR object picker logic in object-picker.js to test against when the VR input device moves or the select button is pressed.\\n\\n[![Pickable And Teleportable Tags](/img/webxr-vr-starter-kit-editor.jpg)](/img/webxr-vr-starter-kit-editor.jpg)\\n\\nWhether it is an object that we can teleport to or interact with is dependent on the other tags on the Entity.\\n\\nIn this case, the aim was to be able to teleport around the video so an Entity with a box render mesh was added to represent the area and \'pickable\' and \'teleportable\' tags were added too.\\n\\nNext up was handling how the controllers should look in VR. The starter kit uses cubes to represent the controllers as they are meant to be replaced with something else by the developer.\\n\\n[![VR Controllers](/img/webxr-vr-starter-kit-controllers.gif)](/img/webxr-vr-starter-kit-controllers.gif)\\n\\nIn my case, I wanted to use skinned hands or the representations of the VR controllers instead. [Max](https://twitter.com/mrmaxm?lang=en) (who built the PlayCanvas WebXR integration) created a project that does just that: [WebXR Controller/Hand Models](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/webxr-controllerhand-models/). And it was just a matter of merging the code and assets together.\\n\\n[![WebXR Hand Tracking](/img/vr-controllers-switch.gif)](/img/vr-controllers-switch.gif)\\n\\n#### Projected skybox\\n\\nThe skybox was obtained from [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/a/orlando_stadium) and converted to a cube map with our [texture tool](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/assets/cubemaps/#converting-equirectangular-or-octahedral-hdris-to-cubemaps). [Donovan](https://twitter.com/slimbuck7) wrote a shader that projected the cubemap so there was a flat floor that the user could move around in.\\n\\nIt\'s a nice and easy effect that can be applied in similar scenes without having to build a model or geometry. See the scene without the effect applied (left) and with it (right):\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'space-between\', marginBottom: \'15px\' }}>\\n    <img src=\\"/img/normal-skybox.gif\\" style={{ width: \'48%\', marginRight: \'2%\' }} alt=\\"Infinite Skybox\\" />\\n    <img src=\\"/img/projected-skybox.gif\\" style={{ width: \'48%\' }} alt=\\"Ground Projected Skybox\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\nThe shader code is applied by overriding the global engine chunk in [projected-skybox-patch.js](https://playcanvas.com/editor/code/988340?tabs=104640973) on application startup.\\n\\n#### World Space UI in VR\\n\\nIn VR, there\'s no concept of \'screen space\' for user interfaces so the playback/exit controls would need to be added somewhere in the world.\\n\\nIt was decided the controls should be placed near the holo-video and would always face the user as, generally, that is where their focus would be.\\n\\n[![VR UI](/img/vr-player-controls-2.gif)](/img/vr-player-controls-2.gif)\\n\\nThis was done by simply having UI buttons in world space as offset child Entities of a \'pivot\' Entity. The pivot Entity is positioned at the feet of the holo-video and can be rotated to face the VR camera.\\n\\nThis was done by simply having UI buttons in world space as offset child Entities of a \'pivot\' Entity. The pivot Entity is positioned at the feet of the holo-video and can be rotated to face the VR camera.\\n\\n[![Setting Up UI In Editor](/img/vr-playback-controls.gif)](/img/vr-playback-controls.gif)\\n\\nThere\'s a [script](https://playcanvas.com/editor/code/988340?tabs=104640973) on the pivot Entity that gets a copy of the VR camera position and sets the Y value to be the same as the pivot Entity\'s. It then uses that position to look at so that the UI controls always stay parallel to the floor.\\n\\nThe other common place to have UI controls would be somewhere relative to a tracked controller such as on the left hand/controller. I decided against this because it\'s not always guaranteed that the VR device would have two hands/controllers such as Google Cardboard.\\n\\nAs the \'floor\' is just a projected skybox, a solution was needed to render the shadows of the holo-video onto the scene.\\n\\n#### Shadow \'catcher\' material\\n\\n[Gustav](https://twitter.com/GustavSterbrant) provided a [material shader](https://playcanvas.com/editor/code/988340?tabs=104640973) that would sample the shadow map and make any area that doesn\'t have a shadow fully transparent.\\n\\nTo make this a bit easier to see, I\'ve shown where the plane would be positioned below. Anywhere where it\'s white on the floor plane would be fully transparent as there is no shadow being cast there.\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'space-between\', marginBottom: \'15px\' }}>\\n    <img src=\\"/img/shadow-catcher-1.jpg\\" style={{ width: \'48%\', marginRight: \'2%\' }} alt=\\"Shadow Receiver Quad\\" />\\n    <img src=\\"/img/shadow-catcher-2.jpg\\" style={{ width: \'48%\' }} alt=\\"Final Shadow Effect\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n### Other tutorials used\\n\\nThere is other functionality in the experience that has been taken from our [tutorial/demo project section](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/) that have been slightly modified for this project.\\n\\nThese include:\\n\\n- [Orbit Camera](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/orbit-camera/) for the non XR camera controls. The orbit camera controls are disabled when the camera entity is disabled so that the camera wouldn\'t move while in a XR session.\\n- [Video Textures](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/video-textures/) for the Microsoft video on the information dialog. [It was modified](https://playcanvas.com/editor/code/988340?tabs=104167290) so that it would apply the video texture directly to the Element on the Entity it was attached to.\\n\\nAlthough not PlayCanvas related, it is worth shouting out: the awesome QR code (that is displayed if the device is not XR compatible) is generated with [Amazing-QR](https://github.com/x-hw/amazing-qr). It\'s able to create colorful and animated QR codes that are more interesting and attractive than the typical black and white versions.\\n\\n[![QR Code](/img/awesome-qr-code.jpg)](/img/awesome-qr-code.jpg)\\n\\n### Issues found\\n\\nThere were a couple of issues found while this project was being developed. We will be searching for solutions in the near future. For now, we\'ve worked around them in a couple of ways.\\n\\nIn VR, clustered lighting with shadows enabled causes a [significant framerate drop](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/issues/4762). As the shadows in the project are from the directional light and they are processed outside the clustered lighting system, clustered lighting shadows can be disabled with no visual change.\\n\\nThe demo uses screen space UI in AR and there\'s an issue with [accuracy of UI touch/mouse events](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/issues/4776) when trying to press UI buttons. This is because, when the user enters AR, the engine uses a projection matrix that matches the device camera so that objects are rendered correctly relative to the real world.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the screen-to-world projections are using the projection matrix directly and instead, using the FOV properties on the camera component. The mismatch is what is causing the inaccuracy.\\n\\nMy workaround is to calculate the relevant camera values from the projection matrix on the first AR render frame and apply that back to the camera component. The code can be seen here in [xr-manager.js](https://playcanvas.com/editor/code/988340?tabs=103708151&line=169).\\n\\n### Wrapping up\\n\\nIf you have reached here, thank you very much for reading and we hope you have found some useful takeaways that you can use in your own projects!\\n\\nUseful links:\\n\\n- [Read more about Microsoft Capture Studios](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mixed-reality/capture-studios)\\n- [Open in Editor](https://playcanvas.com/project/988340/overview/ms-mrcs-holo-video-private)\\n- [Play the Published Build](https://playcanv.as/p/d3xb8X2Q/)\\n\\nWe would love to get your thoughts and feedback so come join the conversation on the [PlayCanvas forum](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/playcanvas-now-supports-microsoft-volumetric-video-playback/29355)!"},{"id":"gltf-import-arrives-in-the-playcanvas-editor","metadata":{"permalink":"/gltf-import-arrives-in-the-playcanvas-editor","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2023-01-19-gltf-import-arrives-in-the-playcanvas-editor.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-19-gltf-import-arrives-in-the-playcanvas-editor.md","title":"glTF 2.0 Import Arrives in the PlayCanvas Editor","description":"We are excited to announce a major update for the PlayCanvas Editor: glTF 2.0 import.

It is an open format that is designed to be efficient and easy to use, making it the perfect choice for use in the PlayCanvas Editor.\\n\\nThe PlayCanvas Editor and run-time now supports the full glTF 2.0 specification, including 100% of ratified glTF extensions (such as sheen, transmission, volume and iridescence). This means that developers can import and use high-quality 3D models and take advantage of the latest advancements in the glTF format to create truly stunning interactive experiences.\\n\\nOne of the major benefits of glTF import is the ability for users to edit glTF materials in the PlayCanvas Editor\'s powerful Material Inspector. Here you can see the famous Stanford Dragon imported from GLB with refraction properties edited live in the Inspector:\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKUvYy1Dyz8\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n_The dragon model based on the one from\xa0[Morgan McGuire\'s Computer Graphics Archive](https://casual-effects.com/data). Original dragon mesh data based on a\xa0[Stanford Scan](http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/)\xa0\xa9 1996 Stanford University._\\n\\nOnce a glTF model is imported into the editor, all of its materials are available to be tweaked and customized. This added flexibility and control will greatly enhance the workflow of developers and allow them to tweak the appearance of assets without having to fire up Blender.\\n\\nAnother great benefit of the new glTF import feature is its integration with PlayCanvas\' Template system. The PlayCanvas Template system allows developers to create reusable and modular components that can be trivially reused across multiple scenes. With the integration of glTF import, developers can now import their 3D models and scenes, and then directly edit the hierarchy, attaching scripts and other component types to the imported scene nodes. This will allow them to create complex and interactive 3D scenes quickly and easily, with minimal coding.\\n\\nAdditionally, the glTF import feature is also integrated with PlayCanvas\' animation system. The PlayCanvas animation system allows developers to create and control animations on their entities and characters. When importing animated glTF/GLB, developers can now quickly set up an Animation State Graph to build simple loops or complex transitions. This will allow them to create more dynamic and interactive 3D scenes, with minimal effort. Check out how it can be done in just a few seconds:\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XE6nBFfWawU\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n_[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/): Low poly fox\xa0[by PixelMannen](https://opengameart.org/content/fox-and-shiba) [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/): Rigging and animation\xa0[by @tomkranis on Sketchfa](https://sketchfab.com/models/371dea88d7e04a76af5763f2a36866bc).  \\nglTF conversion\xa0[by @AsoboStudio and @scurest](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/pull/150#issuecomment-406300118)_\\n\\nIn short, glTF import is a major addition to the PlayCanvas Editor, and will greatly enhance the workflow of our users. It allows developers to:\\n\\n- Faithfully import glTF/GLB files from many different applications and stores.\\n- Edit the materials and hierarchy of imported glTF/GLB files.\\n- Import glTF/GLB animations and quickly configure loops and transitions.\\n\\nWe are thrilled to bring this new feature to our users and we can\'t wait to see the amazing projects that will be created with it.

Tell us about yourself and your studio\\n\\nHey, I\u2019m Leonidas from Solar Games (formerly known as Pirron 1)! I\u2019ve been working with interactive 3D websites since 2012. I used to work as a civil engineer before turning my hobby and passion for gamedev into a full time job using PlayCanvas.\\n\\nTogether with doing PlayCanvas contracts of all sorts, like product configurators, games and promotional sites, I\u2019ve been researching how to extend the PlayCanvas engine and editor. Adding open world terrains, special effects and easy to use networked controllers to match features normally found in native only game engines, led to founding Solar Games.\\n\\nWe offer Uranus Tools for PlayCanvas, a collection of plug and play scripts to supercharge your PlayCanvas creation pipeline. You can find out more about our company\u2019s services at [https://solargames.io](https://solargames.io).\\n\\nWe are also working on [Aritelia](https://aritelia.io), a procedurally generated open world social MMO in PlayCanvas. This is still in development but you can already give it a try with the pre-alpha tech demonstration that was released last year.\\n\\n[![](/img/Leonidas-Developer-Spotlight-5.jpg)](/img/Leonidas-Developer-Spotlight-5.jpg)\\n\\n[![](/img/Leonidas-Developer-Spotlight-1.jpg)](/img/Leonidas-Developer-Spotlight-1.jpg)\\n\\n### Why did you choose PlayCanvas?\\n\\nIt was actually an easy choice for us: by reviewing the mainstream WebGL libraries and platforms, PlayCanvas did stand out for:\\n\\n- Offering an integrated editor and publishing solution. Even after all these years, the ability to easily share projects and builds and collaborate with your colleagues in real-time is something unique to PlayCanvas.\\n- The PlayCanvas team is very productive and professional in the way it moves the platform forward.\\n- The open source PlayCanvas engine provides a very effective and easy to use API.\\n\\n### What were the initial challenges and how did the team overcome them?\\n\\nThe main challenge was the lack of certain features and tools. For example things that you\u2019d take for granted in a native game engine like a terrain system, post effects, automatic instancing and level of detail were missing.\\n\\nThe good news was that even before the PlayCanvas Editor API was officially released, it has always been possible to extend the PlayCanvas Editor. We were able to write our own editor extensions and quickly make them productive in our development pipeline.\\n\\nOther developers and companies became interested in our extensions and we started offering them in our company\u2019s asset store.\\n\\n[![](/img/Leonidas-Developer-Spotlight-2.jpg)](/img/Leonidas-Developer-Spotlight-2.jpg)\\n\\n### How is building an HTML5 game/experience different from a native game/experience?\\n\\nSeveral concepts like rendering, resource loading, game logic and state management are quite similar. But there are some unique concepts when it comes to web-based experiences that can be challenging.\\n\\nIn particular, download times, different display sizes and pixel ratios, a broad spectrum of device specs, and also platform and browser compatibility.\\n\\nTaking into account these factors is mandatory when building a high-quality HTML5 experience.\\n\\n### What are the team\'s favorite features of PlayCanvas?\\n\\nOur favorite feature is the editor, by far. The fact that it is collaborative in real time makes PlayCanvas the best tool for teams to work together. Also, the fact that PlayCanvas has version control integrated is pretty cool! Something else I would add is that PlayCanvas provides a very clean API to work with. Seriously, not only HTML5 devs but also native game devs should give PlayCanvas a try. It\u2019s a great tool to quickly be productive!\\n\\nOther than that:\\n\\n- Asset pipelines like enabling texture compression.\\n- The engine API and the constant addition of new features by the PlayCanvas team.\\n- The community - many greetings to everybody!\\n\\n### What is on the feature wishlist for PlayCanvas this year?\\n\\n- Having the PlayCanvas WebGPU renderer available to play with.\\n- Full support of the new node based shader editor.\\n- Asset variants for specific platforms e.g. serve smaller textures on mobile.\\n\\n### How do you see HTML5 games/experiences evolve over the next few years?\\n\\nIt\u2019s definitely an exciting time for developers and companies working with HTML5 content. Both the technology has moved forward with standards and frameworks being more robust and powerful than ever, and the devices capable of running HTML5 experiences are very capable.\\n\\nThe metaverse is already leveraging HTML5 to deploy worlds and experiences across traditional web2 and newer web3 websites.\\n\\nPixel streaming is the only valid contender when it comes to what HTML5 can offer. I would definitely welcome a feature where pixel streaming is a viable option since it\u2019s a great concept. But right now I don\u2019t see this happening soon.\\n\\nThere are so many opportunities around HTML5 and I see a very positive future for everyone involved.\\n\\n### Thank you very much for your time and we look forward to your presentation\\n\\nThank you for this opportunity to showcase our work!\\n\\n[![](/img/Leonidas-Developer-Spotlight-3.jpg)](/img/Leonidas-Developer-Spotlight-3.jpg)\\n\\n[![](/img/Leonidas-Developer-Spotlight-6.jpg)](/img/Leonidas-Developer-Spotlight-6.jpg)\\n\\nUseful links:\\n\\n- [Play the Solar Stage Demo](https://solargames.io/demos/solar-stage/)\\n- [Twitter @PlayingInCanvas](https://twitter.com/PlayingInCanvas)\\n- [Uranus Tools for PlayCanvas](https://solargames.io/tools/)\\n\\nStay tuned for more Developer Spotlights in the future!"},{"id":"webar-experiences-developer-spotlight-with-animech","metadata":{"permalink":"/webar-experiences-developer-spotlight-with-animech","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2022-10-27-webar-experiences-developer-spotlight-with-animech.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-27-webar-experiences-developer-spotlight-with-animech.md","title":"Web AR Experiences - Developer Spotlight with Animech","description":"Welcome to the third instalment of Developer Spotlight, a series of blog articles where we talk to developers about how they use PlayCanvas and showcase the fantastic work they are doing on the Web.","date":"2022-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ar","permalink":"/tags/ar"},{"inline":true,"label":"webxr","permalink":"/tags/webxr"},{"inline":true,"label":"spotlight","permalink":"/tags/spotlight"}],"readingTime":6.44,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo Oliveira","title":"Associate Partner Support Engineer","page":{"permalink":"/authors/paulo"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulo-oliveira-ninitoph/"},"key":"paulo"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"paulo","slug":"webar-experiences-developer-spotlight-with-animech","title":"Web AR Experiences - Developer Spotlight with Animech","tags":["ar","webxr","spotlight"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Porting Unreal Scenes to the Browser with PlayCanvas - Developer Spotlight with Leonidas Maliokas","permalink":"/porting-unreal-scenes-to-browser-with-playcanvas-developer-spotlight-with-leonidas-maliokas"},"nextItem":{"title":"glTF Viewer Arrives on Mobile with AR Support","permalink":"/gltf-viewer-arrives-on-mobile-with-ar-support"}},"content":"import ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LLuB-2OpcFo\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\nWelcome to the third instalment of Developer Spotlight, a series of blog articles where we talk to developers about how they use PlayCanvas and showcase the fantastic work they are doing on the Web.\\n\\nToday we are excited to be joined by Staffan Hagberg, CMO of [Animech](https://animech.com/en/).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n**Hi Staffan, welcome to Developer Spotlight! Tell us about yourself and Animech!**\\n\\n[Animech](https://www.animech.com/en/) was founded back in 2007, in the city of Uppsala, Sweden. With a mix of 3D artists, engineers, developers, and UI/UX experts, we have a team of 40 people and all the competence in-house. The studio started in the early days of real-time 3D. It was a mix of CAD engineers and developers who realized the power of visualization for selling complex products in the life sciences segment.\\n\\nSince then, we have visualized pretty much anything you can think of online and offline. We\u2019ve worked in VR, AR, MR, phones, tablets, desktops, and pretty much any other device that has a browser. We have developed VR applications for cars, the first real-time 3D configurator in native WebGL ever developed, one of the world\'s first configurators for Oculus Rift Devkit and much more.\\n\\nWe have also visualized experiences for hotel safes, medical instruments and lab products for 7 of the 10 largest life science companies, as well as built 3D converters from Unreal to glTF and a bunch of custom tools specially built for PlayCanvas.\\n\\n[Our core business is real-time 3D](https://www.animech.com/en/articles/3d-rendering-in-realtime). We push the boundaries every day trying to invent new ways of using 3D, where our solution makes the difference.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/animech-bathroom.mp4\\" />\\n\\n_[Bathroom Planner](https://www.inr.se/planera-badrum/planera-badrum-verktyg-3d/) for Iconic Nordic Rooms_\\n\\n**Why did Animech choose PlayCanvas?**\\n\\nAfter an extensive search for a WebGL-based engine, we evaluated a few and selected PlayCanvas for its performance, out-of-the-box features, its extensibility and its valuable editor. Our customers expect the highest level of visual quality along with a smooth browsing experience - without the need for an app or plugins. PlayCanvas truly helps us deliver.\\n\\nAs for our artists\u2019 perspective, they think it was (and still is) the most artist-friendly WebGL editor out there, with the added bonuses that it is open source, and supports many important features, such as PBR, tonemapping, render layers, etc.\\n\\n**Did your team face any initial challenges? How did you overcome them?**\\n\\nIt\'s always challenging when customers have high quality _and_ performance expectations. Though, at the same time, that is what drives us. Being able to create stunning 3D experiences linked to real business value is a unique opportunity and challenge. Adding AR to that process helps you to stand out against competitors.\\n\\nOur particular challenge was to dynamically create an AR model of a procedurally generated mesh as a generic function. Our solution was to create a SaaS service that can take of whatever 3D object you\u2019re looking at in PlayCanvas, and on the fly create AR models for both iOS and Android devices (ARKit or ARCore).\\n\\n**You\u2019ve built several Web AR experiences. Can you tell us a little about them and how important you think Web AR is today?**\\n\\nWe have been early adopters of both AR and VR, both as standalone applications and on the web. We believe it\'s important to use AR not as a gimmick, but as an application that provides real value for the user. For example, looking at how that greenhouse would look in your actual backyard or similar. In that sense, Web AR will get more and more important, both as something that stands out but also as something that provides value for users.\\n\\n[![](/img/developer-spotlight-animech-fjallraven.jpg)](/img/developer-spotlight-animech-fjallraven.jpg)\\n\\n**Why do you think that your clients want Web AR in their experiences?**\\n\\nTo offer something more to their customers - both in marketing value and actual value. To help users make smarter, more informed decisions.\\n\\nWe have also developed our own web based 3D converter that takes our PlayCanvas 3D models to glTF and USD on the fly. It is a server side solution that takes everything we develop to AR.\\n\\n**How is building a web experience different from a native experience?**\\n\\nYou must optimize for both loading time and performance. The application could be run on a wide range of devices \u2013 from several years old phones to high-end desktops.\\n\\nThe application is accessible to a wider audience since they don\u2019t need to install anything.\\n\\n**What are the team\'s favorite features of PlayCanvas?**\\n\\nAs a team consisting of both 3D artists and developers, PlayCanvas\u2019 online editor provides a fantastic way to collaborate, prepare and preview our projects before pairing the solution with a stunning web UI or deploying it as a standalone viewer.\\n\\nOur 3D artists also enjoy how the editor is robust and easy to use, and how its design promotes collaboration. Powerful material settings (per-texture UV and color channel, vertex colors, blend types, depth test/write, etc.), flexible texture compression and a fast response by the team when reporting bugs and requesting features are also great.\\n\\n**What is on the feature wish list for PlayCanvas this year?**\\n\\nAs the future for 3D on the web continues to evolve, we are excited to see support for more accessible 3D formats, such as the glTF standard by the Khronos Group, which PlayCanvas are advocating for as well.\\n\\nBeyond this, here are some things we look forward to:\\n\\n- Node-based shader editor\\n- Support for editor extensions\\n- Post processing (HDR bloom, chromatic aberration, SSAO, motion blur, color grading, eye adaption, etc.)\\n- More customizable asset import options\\n- Reflection probes\\n- Material instances (see Unreal Engine)\\n- Debug visualization (see Unreal Engine\u2019s View Modes)\\n- Expose currently hidden options in the editor (detail maps, etc.)\\n\\n**How do you see AR and 3D e-commerce evolve over the next few years?**\\n\\nThe possibilities are enormous. The question is when do people actually start using AR. It has been around for many years, lots of interesting solutions and demos have been built, but the real value of AR has not reached the masses yet.\\n\\nI think we are closing in on that though. Just the other day I was about to buy a new espresso coffee machine. One supplier had an AR model online in the e-store with which I could see that it looked good and covered my needs. With just one static USDZ file. It is such an easy way of helping your customer to make the right decision. Imagine how much value you add if you can see configured 3D models in AR and really see the potential of what you are about to buy.\\n\\nNext phase would be to configure and change your 3D model directly in AR-mode which would make the experience even stronger.\\n\\nAs the graphics quality gets better and better online and the fashion industry keeps on digitizing their customer journey, AR will probably be the best and easiest way of trying on fashion products like bags, watches, jewelry and clothes. It will reduce faulty orders on a massive scale if you can do a virtual fitting before buying stuff online.\\n\\nAnimech helps our customers to get what they want. Simply put: we empower people to make smart decisions through intelligent visualization.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/animech-cytiva.mp4\\" />\\n\\n**Thank you, Staffan!

The mode you get currently differs based on the operating system you\u2019re using.\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'space-between\', marginBottom: \'15px\' }}>\\n    <img src=\\"/img/gltf-viewer-mobile-ar-ios.gif\\" style={{ width: \'49%\' }} alt=\\"glTF Viewer AR on iOS\\" />\\n    <img src=\\"/img/gltf-viewer-mobile-ar-android.gif\\" style={{ width: \'49%\' }} alt=\\"glTF Viewer AR on Android\\" />\\n</div>\\n_Quick Look mode on iOS (left) and WebXR mode on Android (right)_\\n\\nOn iOS, the model will be loaded with Apple\u2019s AR Quick Look mode (above left), while on Android the model will be placed into your environment using WebXR (above right).\\n\\n### Mobile-Optimized Design\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'space-between\', marginBottom: \'15px\' }}>\\n    <img src=\\"/img/gltf-viewer-mobile-start.png\\" style={{ width: \'32%\' }} alt=\\"glTF Viewer Mobile Start\\" />\\n    <img src=\\"/img/gltf-viewer-mobile-controls.png\\" style={{ width: \'32%\' }} alt=\\"glTF Viewer Mobile Controls\\" />\\n    <img src=\\"/img/gltf-viewer-mobile-hierarchy.png\\" style={{ width: \'32%\' }} alt=\\"glTF Viewer Mobile Hierarchy\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\nIt\u2019s now possible to verify the content and rendering of your assets no matter which device you\u2019re working on. The viewer has been redesigned using mobile-first principles, so you can explore glTF content just as well on mobile as you can on desktop. The UI scales up or down depending on the device screen size and takes an uncluttered approach to ensure you can focus on the glTF content itself even on very small screens.\\n\\n### Quickly Load Models on Mobile Devices\\n\\nWhen loading PlayCanvas viewer v3.0 on desktop, you\u2019ll be presented with the option to load a glTF model from a URL.\\n\\n![glTF Viewer Start Screen](/img/gltf-viewer-start.png)\\n\\nWhen this is used, the application will generate a QR code you can scan to share the current viewer scene between your devices or others:\\n\\n![Share with QR Code](/img/gltf-viewer-share.png)\\n\\n### New PlayCanvas Theme\\n\\nThe latest release of [PCUI (v2.7.0)](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui/releases/tag/v2.7.0) enables the use of additional themes in applications built using it. This allowed us to apply a new color theme to the model-viewer:\\n\\n[![New PCUI Theme](/img/gltf-viewer-new-theme.png)](/img/gltf-viewer-new-theme.png)\\n\\nThe new muted gray tones of this theme should allow users to more readily focus on their model content. Over the coming months, you\u2019ll begin to see this new theme applied to more applications in the PlayCanvas ecosystem! Be sure to pass any feedback onto us using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui/issues) of the PCUI library.\\n\\n### Open Source\\n\\nPlayCanvas is fully committed to an open source strategy and our glTF viewer is therefore made available to you on [GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/model-viewer). It is a TypeScript application built on PlayCanvas [PCUI](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui) front-end framework and, of course, the [PlayCanvas Engine](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine) runtime.\\n\\nThese open source projects have been years in the making and would not have been possible without the amazing OSS community. So why not explore our various GitHub repositories and consider making some contributions of your own. We also appreciate feature requests and bug reports, so don\u2019t be shy!\\n\\n[**FORK THE VIEWER ON GITHUB**](https://github.com/playcanvas/model-viewer)\\n\\nWe hope you find the new and improved glTF viewer useful for your projects.

A series of blog articles where we talk to developers about how they use PlayCanvas and showcase the fantastic work they are doing on the Web.\\n\\nToday we are excited to be joined by Frantz Lasorne, co-founder of [Visionaries777](https://www.vz777.com/).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n**Hi! Let\'s get started. Firstly, welcome to the developer spotlight! Frantz, if you could just tell me a little bit about yourself and your team and your studio.**\\n\\nMy name is Frantz and I\'m the co-founder of Visionaries777. Actually, we [founders] are three. We started as two French guys. We studied together in France; Interaction Design, and then we created this company about 10 years ago in Hong Kong.\\n\\n[We currently employ] Around 35 people. We\'ve been working on AR since 2010. It\'s our main focus. Within the realm of AR, we are involved in 3D real time AR, and all sorts of XR applications.\\n\\nMe and my business partner were working at Lego in Denmark before, so we started to work on AR back then in the R&D department. We helped Lego bridge the physical and digital to create hybrid play experiences.\\n\\nAfterwards, we left Lego and started our own company. Lego hired us as consultants to keep working for them for some time. In the early days, we did a lot of collaborations for marketing and promotional events using AR.\\n\\nNowadays, the things we work on are more industrial-focused; automotive or luxury. AR is now a properly matured product, with WebGL, Web AR experiences, VR and so on.\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnoiJA7UCiY\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n**Thank you! I\'m curious, why did Visionaries777 choose PlayCanvas?**\\n\\nBefore, we always used Unity 3D for any 3D real time project, because they have a huge compatibility of hardware platforms. It\'s quite nice. The only platform they are lacking is the web.\\n\\nWe were looking around, trying to find what is the best platform to develop WebGL experiences. Then, we saw PlayCanvas, opened the editor, and were surprised how familiar it was for us. I think the people who designed the PlayCanvas editor knew Unity and got inspired in terms of the menu and layout. It\'s very similar to the way [Unity] works. It\'s just that it\'s an editor on the web rather than a desktop application. So for us, it was very easy to do the jump.\\n\\nSo far we\'ve been really happy with all the engine capabilities, the loading, how lightweight it is, et cetera. For us, it\'s the best platform for developing web experiences.\\n\\n[![Husqvarna](/img/v777-husqvarna.jpg)](/img/v777-husqvarna.jpg)\\n\\n**Awesome! So, were there any initial challenges that you guys faced? How did you guys end up overcoming them?**\\n\\nIn terms of challenges? I think mostly the model optimizations; how to get the WebGL experience as small as possible, but retaining maximum visual quality. Most of our clients are either automotive brands or luxury brands, so they are concerned about the product that you are looking at on the screen. It\'s pointless to show a product that you can see the rough edges of. They won\'t like it in the end.\\n\\nThat was our struggle at the beginning - to try and find the right balance of optimizing enough, but not too much, and be happy with loading time. So it took some trying to get this right and find the right compromise.\\n\\nRight now, with our current approach and the tools in our pipeline, we\u2019re quite happy. And it\'s also why we work with Cartier and are now doing all these products on their websites.\\n\\n[![Watch](/img/v777-watch.jpg)](/img/v777-watch.jpg)\\n\\n**That\'s very interesting. Visionaries777 has worked on several Web AR experiences. Can you tell me how important you think Web AR is today?**\\n\\nIt\'s very important - but we are back to the same problem that we had in the early 2010s, when we relied on markers for tracking. Now with where we are in WebAR we are still very limited. You need something like an image marker, or a floor with a world target, but it\'s not as stable as if you use AR Kit or AR Core in a native Unity app.\\n\\nWith a standalone Unity application with ARKit and ARCore it\'s mind blowing what you can do. There\'s barely any drift, it\'s super accurate. With web you\'re still constrained. Tracking is not perfect. There\'s a lot of drift. So I think the applications we see with the present state of tech are limited, experiences are considered a bit gimmicky. It\'s getting there, but it still needs to grow.\\n\\nBut at the end of the day, for marketing initiatives, no one wants to install an ad app on their smartphone as a user, as a consumer. You don\'t want to install a BMW app just to uninstall it three days later because you\'re done playing around.\\n\\nThese sorts of experiences were fine 10 years ago on an iPhone, but now people have moved on, and have different mindsets - things should be accessible through a web browser directly, not through an app. If it\'s inside an app, it has to be inside Snapchat, inside Instagram, or inside an app that has more to it than just one AR experience.\\n\\n[![BMW](/img/v777-bmw.jpg)](/img/v777-bmw.jpg)\\n\\n**Extending a bit from that question, why do you think that the clients you work with want Web AR in their experiences?**\\n\\nAugmented reality has always been exciting for brands to show a product in 3D and also integrate it into [customers\u2019] homes or their driveway. It\u2019s quite appealing for a brand, marketing-wise. Then, for consumers, it\'s something new, it\'s fun. You get closer to the product.\\n\\nIt\u2019s key to reduce friction.\\n\\nYou don\'t have to install things anymore. You download some assets in your web browser, but it\'s more transparent than going into the store and searching for the app and downloading it.\\n\\nBrands are definitely interested in WebAR for these reasons, so AR will keep growing. It brings a lot of value. You can try a car in your driveway or you can try a watch on your wrist.\\n\\neCommerce in a more immersive way is really the next generation for eCommerce experiences.\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGx9gFHWu_4\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n**When you\'re building your Web AR experiences, what features does PlayCanvas provide that you think were most helpful?**\\n\\nI think the true value of PlayCanvas is really how they are keeping up to date with all the WebGL standards, improving materials, improving compression, improving loading and so on. And their UI is very easy to use.\\n\\nWhen you import your model, it gets converted to the GLB format. It makes it more lightweight, and you don\'t need to pre-export it as GLB.\\n\\nOn the programming side, it\'s just JavaScript. You can do whatever you want. It doesn\'t have any preset for you aside from an orbit camera, but that\'s not really important. Anyone can build more.\\n\\n**Cool! So, how would you say that building an HTML5 or a WebGL experience differs from developing a native experience or a native application?**\\n\\nYou have to always concern yourself with the loading. In some cases, when you develop a web experience, you have to load something quickly for the user to play with right away. Then the model and the rest gets loaded progressively afterwards. Let\'s say you have a car and this car has variants with different wheels, roofs, and so on. All these elements need to be loaded, but you shouldn\'t load everything at once. Otherwise, the download would be huge.\\n\\nI think that\'s one of the main differences compared to designing a native application, aside from UX/UI, because you also need to be concerned about the browser for web experiences. Are you using it in portrait? On a desktop? Do you need to embed it into an iframe? Is it going to be full screen?\\n\\nThose are questions that are quite different from a standalone application where you don\'t need to concern yourself about the surroundings of the app.\\n\\n**So next up; we went a bit over this in one of the previous questions I asked. You explained how you guys use some of the features of the editor, but is there any feature PlayCanvas provides that is the team\'s favorite?**\\n\\nTo me it\'s more that we can collaborate. The collaboration aspect of PlayCanvas is quite nice because you have one project and anyone can access it from their desktop machine on the web.\\n\\nAnd you can, as an artist, populate the scene with the assets. Then, the developer can work with it. In parallel. And you can have someone to check things, maybe not edit anything, but do quality control. The collaboration aspect is one of the best features I would say that makes [PlayCanvas] so nice to work with.\\n\\n**As part of the interview, but also as a feedback exercise, what is a PlayCanvas feature that would be at the top of your wishlist?**\\n\\nIt would be great if the PlayCanvas editor had a feature to assign different texture resolutions for different platforms (mobile or desktop), similarly to how Unity does it for different devices. It would make it so much easier to manage rather than doing it with code and tagging etc.\\n\\n**Thanks for sharing the feedback! Going back to another question, how do you see HTML5 and web experiences evolving over the next few years?**\\n\\nI think it will grow. We see two things at the moment, WebGL experiences and cloud streaming, which is not HTML or WebGL at all. Some brands will choose either doing a WebGL configurator, or a cloud streaming configurator. Those are two different approaches. I have a tendency to prefer WebGL because you have a much more crisp image.\\n\\nAlso, once the experience is loaded, it\'s much more responsive to commands. You\'re not constrained by latency of streaming and video glitches. Those are things that put me off when I do classroom experiences.\\n\\nSo I think WebGL will continue, especially right now with the whole discussion around the metaverse, and when we talk about the necessary file transmission. GLTF, USDZ, USD - those files can be translated from one platform to another, so I think there\'s a lot of potential for these.\\n\\nI think the metaverse will most likely be built in WebGL rather than in cloud streaming, but I could be wrong.\\n\\nEither way, I believe that in the end, it\'s very important for brands to start digitizing all their assets. For example, Cartier chooses to have a WebGL viewer and recreate every single one of their products into GLB formats. I think it\'s quite smart because once you have them, you can reuse them anywhere on the web; whether it\'s in their website, the metaverse or a Snapchat AR filter.\\n\\nI think there\'s lots of opportunities, and as 5G expands, compression format algorithms get more efficient, things are going to be smaller and we\'ll be able to build richer experiences on the web. I think there\'s a long positive future, and cloud streaming is not necessarily going to replace it.\\n\\n**Thank you! Those were all the questions I had. Thank you for your time, Frantz!

Tell us about yourself and your studio\\n\\nHello! My name is Christina Kaliora and I\u2019m a Games Programmer. I wrote my first line of code in September of 2016 inside PlayCanvas! I still remember that excitement when I saw my cube rotating! That\u2019s when I said \\"This is what I wanna do!\\".\\n\\nAfter that, I started learning more about PlayCanvas and experimenting with other Game Engines, like Unity. Later, I attended an online coding bootcamp about web development, and since then, I work as a freelancer both for Web Development projects and web based games (using PlayCanvas).\\n\\nAlso, together with my husband and some friends we run a company called Solar Games, where we develop tools and projects for PlayCanvas.\\n\\n### Why did you choose PlayCanvas?\\n\\nPlayCanvas caught my attention from the very beginning! Some of the main reasons me and my team choose PlayCanvas:\\n\\n- PlayCanvas is one of the most powerful web based game engines out there.\\n- It is the only web based game engine that has such a powerful and collaborative editor.\\n- It has amazing support in the forums and discord and also, a great team to back it up!\\n- It has very good performance!\\n\\n### What were the initial challenges and how did the team overcome them?\\n\\nPersonally, when I started, I had a very hard time getting a good grasp of PlayCanvas. There weren\u2019t that many tutorial projects back then and since I was pretty much a newbie in coding, I had a very hard time understanding the coding concepts of game development.\\n\\nWhat helped me there, was building smaller projects focused on specific areas, for example physics, player movement, raycast, UI, shaders etc. That way, I learned how to work with the API and I was able to start building larger projects/games.\\n\\nAlso, studying the engine\u2019s code is something that any aspiring PlayCanvas developer should get into and helped me personally! Learning the inside and out of the game engine you\'re using will help you tremendously!\\n\\n### How is building an HTML5 game/experience different from a native game/experience?\\n\\nIt is quite different in my opinion. Since things on the web work a bit differently, there are also different things that need to be taken into consideration. For example, loading times and download size are some very important things that web game devs need to pay attention to.\\n\\nNo one wants to wait over 30 seconds for a web page to load, right?\\n\\n### What are the team\'s favorite features of PlayCanvas?\\n\\nFavorite feature is the editor, by far. The fact that it is collaborative in real time, makes PlayCanvas the best tool for teams to work together. Also, the fact that PlayCanvas has version control integrated, is pretty cool! Something else I would add, is that PlayCanvas provides a very clean API to work with.\\n\\n### What is on the feature wishlist for PlayCanvas this year?\\n\\nOh, there are so many things, but I will short down my list down to three:\\n\\n- More starter templates!\\n- I would love to see the list of post processing effects growing! There isn\u2019t something better than a web based game with nice graphics and effects. It would be great to provide developers with the tools to do so.\\n- Better particle editor. We need more VFX artists in PlayCanvas!\\n\\n### How do you see HTML5 games/experiences evolve over the next few years?\\n\\nI think that, since the devices are becoming more and more powerful and with the webGPU on the way, web games will become more and more popular.\\n\\nImagine, being able to play your game both on any web browser, phone, tv without the need of downloading and installing anything? It\u2019s mind blowing to me!\\n\\nAnd now with all the Metaverse buzz I see that web based experiences are gaining more and more attention.\\n\\n### Thank you very much for your time and we look forward to your presentation\\n\\nThank you very much for inviting me!\\n\\nUseful links:\\n\\n- [Play the game](https://playcanv.as/p/atVPbI8K/)\\n- [Public project link](https://playcanvas.com/project/917469/overview/john-lemon-public-project)\\n- [Twitter @christinaKlra](https://twitter.com/christinaKlra)\\n- [Portfolio](https://solargames.io/christina/)\\n\\nStay tuned for more Developer Spotlights in the future!"},{"id":"our-2022-developer-showreel-is-live","metadata":{"permalink":"/our-2022-developer-showreel-is-live","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2022-09-05-our-2022-developer-showreel-is-live.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-05-our-2022-developer-showreel-is-live.md","title":"Our 2022 developer showreel is live!","description":"Welcome to our 2022 showcase, showing some of the very best WebGL browser games and experiences made with PlayCanvas!","date":"2022-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.92,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Yau","title":"Partner Relations Manager","page":{"permalink":"/authors/steven"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/yaustar","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenyau/","github":"https://github.com/yaustar"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/yaustar.png","key":"steven"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"steven","slug":"our-2022-developer-showreel-is-live","title":"Our 2022 developer showreel is live!"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Porting from Unity to PlayCanvas - Developer Spotlight with Christina Kaliora","permalink":"/porting-from-unity-to-playcanvas-developer-spotlight-with-christina-kaliora"},"nextItem":{"title":"PlayCanvas Releases glTF Viewer 2.0","permalink":"/playcanvas-releases-gltf-viewer-2-0"}},"content":"Welcome to our 2022 showcase, showing some of the very best WebGL browser games and experiences made with PlayCanvas!\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/46f73gp1_TU\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer;

With support for advanced shading techniques, it is particularly important for graphics intensive applications like product configurators/visualizers.\\n\\nWith so many companies now relying on glTF to transmit graphics data over the web, it is critical that high quality tools are available to work with the format. This led us to develop v2.0 of our popular glTF viewer.\\n\\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at what\u2019s new.\\n\\n## Improved glTF Specification Support\\n\\nThe glTF format is managed by the Khronos Group and defines a base specification along with a variety of extensions. The first version of the viewer supports 100% of the base spec plus the following extensions:\\n\\n- `KHR_draco_mesh_compression`\\n- `KHR_lights_punctual`\\n- `KHR_materials_clearcoat`\\n- `KHR_materials_unlit`\\n- `KHR_mesh_quantization`\\n- `KHR_texture_basisu`\\n- `KHR_texture_transform`\\n\\nThe new and improved viewer released today adds support for:\\n\\n- `KHR_materials_emissive_strength`\\n- `KHR_materials_ior`\\n- `KHR_materials_sheen`\\n- `KHR_materials_specular`\\n- `KHR_materials_transmission`\\n- `KHR_materials_variants`\\n- `KHR_materials_volume`\\n\\nThese extensions provide developers with the ability to achieve exciting new graphical effects.\\n\\nLet\u2019s take a look at three of them.\\n\\n## Advanced Refraction\\n\\nThe volume, transmission, and ior glTF extensions can simulate how light is refracted through transparent materials. This leverages PlayCanvas\u2019 grab pass functionality to \u2018grab\u2019 and sample the back-buffer.\\n\\n[![Dragon with IOR, Transmission and Volume](/img/gltf-ior-transmission-volume.gif)](/img/gltf-ior-transmission-volume.gif)\\n\\n## Realistic Rendering of Fabrics\\n\\nglTF\u2019s sheen extension enables developers to faithfully reproduce materials with the appearance of certain fabrics. This is incredibly important for production visualization (home furnishings, apparel, vehicle interiors, and so on).\\n\\n[![Cushion with Sheen](/img/gltf-sheen.jpg)](/img/gltf-sheen.jpg)\\n\\n## Material Variants\\n\\nMost product configurators allow the user to modify the appearance of a product. For example, a specific style of chair might be upholstered in various fabrics in various colors. Or a pair of shoes might be available in a number of different designs/patterns/colors.\\n\\n[![Sneakers with Material Variants](/img/gltf-material-variants.jpg)](/img/gltf-material-variants.jpg)\\n\\nThe PlayCanvas viewer now detects any material variants in the loaded scene and permits their selection in the interface.\\n\\n[![Material Variants in glTF Viewer](/img/gltf-viewer-material-variants.gif)](/img/gltf-viewer-material-variants.gif)\\n\\n## Rendering Enhancements\\n\\nThe new viewer introduces a couple of interesting features if you care about rendering fidelity.\\n\\nFirst up is a \u2018High Quality Rendering\u2019 mode (which is a toggle in the Camera control panel).\\n\\nEnabling this feature activates supersampling which is a type of antialiasing that aims to eliminate jagged edges along polygons. It progressively re-renders the scene many times when the camera stops, slightly offsetting and then compositing the rendered image over previous frames.\\n\\nYou can see both in action below, deliberately reduced in resolution to show the effect:\\n\\n[![glTF Viewer High Quality Mode](/img/gltf-viewer-high-quality-rendering.gif)](/img/gltf-viewer-high-quality-rendering.gif)\\n\\nAlso new is sharper reflections for smooth reflective surfaces. The viewer will now use the full resolution skybox cubemap in the engine\u2019s image-based lighting pipeline which looks crisp and far more realistic.\\n\\n[![High Quality Reflections](/img/engine-sharp-reflections.jpg)](/img/engine-sharp-reflections.jpg)\\n\\n## Interface Redesign\\n\\nInitially, all information and controls for the viewer appeared in the leftmost panel. Viewer 2.0 has been completely redesigned to more intelligently group specific areas of functionality. The leftmost panel remains but now just shows scene info and a tree view showing the loaded scene hierarchy.\\n\\n[![glTF Viewer Left Panel](/img/gltf-viewer-hierarchy.png)](/img/gltf-viewer-hierarchy.png)\\n\\nButtons to control viewer settings can now be found at the bottom of the 3D view. These buttons open options for camera, lighting, and debug rendering (plus a fullscreen toggle).\\n\\n[![glTF Viewer Buttons](/img/gltf-viewer-buttons.gif)](/img/gltf-viewer-buttons.gif)\\n\\nIf you load a scene that contains animation, animation controls will automatically appear:\\n\\n[![glTF Viewer Animation Controls](/img/gltf-viewer-animation-controls.png)](/img/gltf-viewer-animation-controls.png)\\n\\nThe controls allow you to scrub through an animation, select playback speed, and even choose which animation clip to play should the file contain more than one.\\n\\nLastly, there is also now a button bottom right to download a rendered PNG of the 3D view.\\n\\n[![glTF Viewer Download Screenshot](/img/gltf-viewer-screenshot.png)](/img/gltf-viewer-screenshot.png)\\n\\n## Open Source\\n\\nPlayCanvas is fully committed to an open-source strategy and our glTF viewer is therefore made available to you on [GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/model-viewer). It is a TypeScript application built on PlayCanvas [PCUI](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui) front-end framework and, of course, the [PlayCanvas Engine](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine) runtime.\\n\\nThese open source projects have been years in the making and would not have been possible without the amazing OSS community. So why not explore our various GitHub repositories and consider making some contributions of your own.

In that time, we have seen WebGL become the world\'s standard for web graphics, implemented into every major web browser. And we have done our part to help make WebGL content creation both easy and fun!\\n\\n2021 was definitely our most productive year yet. The platform has continued to evolve, delivering a host of new features and performance improvements.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nLet\'s take a look at some of the highlights:\\n\\n## Tools Updates\\n\\nAs you might expect, the vast majority of PlayCanvas users build their applications in the Editor. Perhaps the biggest Editor-related story this year was the release of our new [Editor API](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/designer/editor-api/) that allows you to automate certain operations in the Editor front-end. And this is just the first step. We will be fleshing out the Editor API further in 2022 with the goal of building a fully fledged plugin system. Stay tuned for updates on that.\\n\\nThe Code Editor also received a major upgrade this year when [we switched from CodeMirror to Monaco](https://blog.playcanvas.com/upcoming-code-editor-upgrade-to-monaco/), the text editor that powers Visual Studio Code. So if you were already a VS Code user, you should feel right at home in the new Code Editor. It brings better performance for handling large text files, better code completion, a powerful command palette and even theme selection.\\n\\nAnimation tooling also received a huge boost in 2021 with the introduction of the [Anim State Graph Editor](https://blog.playcanvas.com/introducing-the-anim-state-graph/).\\n\\n[![](/img/animation-and-graph.gif)](/img/animation-and-graph.gif)AnimStateGraph Editor\\n\\nYou now have the ability to author anything from simple animation cycles to advanced locomotion systems. Check out how indie developer Cem Demir is using the new animation system in his forthcoming multiplayer survival game:\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\"twitter-tweet\\"><p lang=\\"und\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">\ud83d\udc40 !? <a href=\\"https://t.co/QD2CDyAzhT\\">pic.twitter.com/QD2CDyAzhT</a></p>&mdash; Cem (@cemdemir) <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/cemdemir/status/1469791447134220289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\\">December 11, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\" charset=\\"utf-8\\"><\/script>\\n\\nWith all of the front-end updates to the Editor, don\'t think that we have neglected the back-end! Throughout 2021, we have been diligently rebuilding the platform\'s back-end to be more reliable, scalable and responsive. Users around the globe should now be experiencing Editor and Launch Page load times that are up to 50% faster. In addition, asset related jobs should now complete faster meaning you can focus on building with less time waiting.\\n\\nAside from the Editor, one of the coolest new tools we released this year was the [Engine Examples Browser](https://playcanvas.github.io/). This is a coding playground for learning and experimenting with the PlayCanvas Engine API. And naturally, it\'s fully open sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/tree/dev/examples#readme).\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/examples-browser.mp4\\" />\\n\\n_Engine Examples Browser_\\n\\nBack in the summer, we [announced](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/rfc-shader-editor/20616) our new Node-based Shader Editor. This is a new and accessible way to build custom shaders for your PlayCanvas application.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/shader-editor.mp4\\" />\\n\\n_Node-based Shader Editor_\\n\\nWe\'re nearing the end of the closed beta and in the coming months, we will kick off an open beta and fully open source the tool.\\n\\nThe [PlayCanvas Viewer](https://playcanvas.com/viewer) is our open source 3D model viewer tool. In 2021, it received a number of important improvements. First up, as well as glTF files, the viewer can now also load VOX files (for voxel based scenes constructed in tools like MagicaVoxel). We also improved skeletal visualization as well as skybox handling. Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/playcanvas-viewer)!\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/gltf-viewer-vox.mp4\\" />\\n\\n_PlayCanvas glTF Viewer_\\n\\n## Graphics Engine Enhancements\\n\\nLet\'s be honest - everybody loves beautifully rendered pixels. So let\'s examine how PlayCanvas\' graphics engine has advanced this year. First up, we have area lights that allow lights to adopt a physical shape: rectangle, circle or sphere. Later in the year, we released a preview or our new clustered lighting pipeline, which essentially increases the number of dynamic lights you can place in your scenes. With both features combined, the engine can now process clustered area lights as our [new engine example](https://playcanvas.github.io/#/graphics/clustered-area-lights) demonstrates.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/engine-clustered-area-lights.mp4\\" />\\n\\n_Clustered Area Lights_\\n\\nYou can expect clustered lighting to fully replace the existing lighting system in early 2022 once it has been thoroughly beta-tested.\\n\\nPlayCanvas\' run-time lightmapper received a major upgrade this year. Previously, it was only able to bake direct light to lightmaps and while this could speed up scene load and render times, direct lighting alone struggles to deliver high quality visuals. Now, it can generate soft shadows and bake ambient occlusion. Check out the [new engine example](https://playcanvas.github.io/#/graphics/lights-baked-ao) that shows off these amazing new capabilities:\\n\\n[![](/img/soft-shadows.gif)](/img/soft-shadows.gif)\\n\\nLastly, we implemented cascaded shadows maps that dramatically boosts shadow quality for large-scale environments. It didn\'t take long for the community to start showcasing the benefits:\\n\\n<blockquote class=\\"twitter-tweet\\"><p lang=\\"en\\" dir=\\"ltr\\">Testing the dev branch that adds support for cascaded shadow mapping in the <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/playcanvas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\\">@playcanvas</a> engine, couldn&#39;t resist\ud83d\ude07!

The [Engine runtime](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine) was originally open sourced way back in [June 2014](https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-goes-open-source/). Today, it has 6,932 stars,1,095 forks and 96 individual contributors (who we want to thank for all their incredible contributions). Simply put, PlayCanvas would not be what it is today without our amazing open source community.\\n\\n2021 saw us double down on our open source mission with an explosion of new and updated OSS projects:\\n\\n- [Editor API](https://github.com/playcanvas/editor-api) - the core functionality of the Editor\\n- [PCUI](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui) and [PCUI-Graph](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui-graph) - a front-end framework for building powerful browser-based tools\\n- [Observer](https://github.com/playcanvas/playcanvas-observer) - an implementation of the observer pattern for web application development\\n- [PlayCanvas Viewer](https://github.com/playcanvas/playcanvas-viewer) - a fast and lightweight 3D model viewer\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the new Shader Editor will be joining this list in 2022. And we shall continue to open source more and more of our technology over time.\\n\\n## 2021 Content Picks\\n\\nWe have been blown away by the incredible content the community has created. Browser and messenger games, 3D configurators, VR and AR apps, playable ads and more. We recently published an updated PlayCanvas Showcase video that highlights some of the best examples:\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FrUUrVRpbzg\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\nOur top picks for 2021 are:\\n\\n- [Snap Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlbRDJhUXwE) - Snapchat\'s HTML5 gaming platform featuring new arrivals such as Hole.io and Aquapark\\n- [Bullet Bonanza](https://www.bulletbonanza.io/) - Frenetic online multiplayer game made by Kiloo\\n- [Fj\xe4llr\xe4ven K\xe5nken](https://www.fjallraven.com/uk/en-gb/bags-gear/kanken/kanken-bags/kanken-me) - Backpack configurator made by Animech\\n- [The Crypt](https://www.crypt.art/) - NFT gallery made by Kuva\\n\\nFor more PlayCanvas examples, check out the [Awesome List](https://github.com/playcanvas/awesome-playcanvas#blockchaincryptonft).\\n\\n## What\'s In Store for 2022?\\n\\nWe already provided some hints about our 2022 roadmap. The Shader Editor makes its debut in Q1. The Editor\'s Plugin System will appear later in the year. But what else?\\n\\nPlayCanvas\' glTF support will continue to advance. All remaining glTF 2.0 extensions will be implemented and we will finally release a glTF exporter (that you will be able to invoke from the Editor).\\n\\nWebGPU, the forthcoming successor to WebGL, is also in our sights for 2022. As we continue to push the limits of 3D rendering on the web, WebGPU is a critical part of our plans. So 2022 will see us release an initial proof of concept of WebGPU support and we will share our findings with you as soon as we have them.\\n\\nFor a final peek into PlayCanvas\' future, we would like to share our plan to release what we are calling the \'Visual Debugger\'. This tool will run in the Editor\'s Launch Page. You will be able to pause the app, single step it, inspect the hierarchy and entity properties and even edit them in real-time.\\n\\nWe have so much more planned and we will publish a full 2022 public roadmap in the coming weeks. In the meantime, if you have any of your own feature requests, please do log them [here](https://github.com/playcanvas/editor/issues).\\n\\nHave a wonderful 2022 everyone!

We\u2019re excited to be able to share how it works in this blog.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Animating characters\\n\\nWhen creating complex animation behavior for games, it is often necessary to make a character carry out multiple actions at once. For instance, you might want to create a character that can pick up and carry an item, or shoot a weapon while freely moving around a scene.\\n\\nTo perform these actions at the same time, the upper and lower body of the character must be animated independently. The upper body should be able to move from an idle stance to a shooting stance, and then shoot on demand, all while the lower body moves between idling, walking, running based on the player\'s command.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/anim-masked-locomotion.mp4\\" />\\n\\n_A character with two animation layers. A movement layer and a shooting layer masked to the upper body_\\n\\nThis effect can be difficult to achieve in most 3D engines, as it usually requires removing certain animated bones in the animation files themselves, before importing those assets into a game project. Only then would a developer be able to create two animation layers, one for movement and another for shooting.\\n\\nA shooting animation might have all of its lower body bones removed, which would free up the lower body to be animated by the movement layer. In large projects, this can start to become really cumbersome. Adding or removing bones from an animation would require a rebuild of the animation asset in whichever modelling software the developer is using, followed by a reimport of the asset into the PlayCanvas project.\\n\\n## Anim Layer Masks\\n\\nMasks can streamline this workflow by enabling developers to add or remove a model\u2019s bones from an animation layer directly. This means you can select which part of a character a particular set of animations should animate directly in the PlayCanvas editor. Testing out different combinations of character bones now becomes as simple as toggling a few checkboxes.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/anim-layer-masking.mp4\\" />\\n\\n_Creating layer masks in the PlayCanvas editor_\\n\\nBy selecting only the bones in the upper body of the character model for an anim layer, you can free up the lower body to be animated by previous layers which would have been overwritten without this upper body mask.\\n\\n## Anim Layer Blending\\n\\nPreviously when using the anim component, you could play any number of animations on top of each other by creating multiple anim layers. However, any animations from subsequent layers that animate the same bones as previous ones will completely overwrite those previous animations.\\n\\nThat meant that even if you were to add a shooting animation to the top half of a character, it would always be playing over a walking animation that was placed on a previous layer.\\n\\nNow with anim layer blending, it is possible to smoothly blend subsequent layers in and out, changing the weight each layer contributes to the characters animation in real time.\\n\\n![](/img/anim-layer-blending2.gif)  \\n_Animation layer blending in the PlayCanvas examples browser_\\n\\nWhen editing an AnimStateGraph asset, you\u2019re now presented with two `Blend Type` options in each layer. The `Overwrite` option is set by default and works as before, each subsequent layer completely overwrites the animation values of previous layers.\\n\\nHowever, now, if you select the \u2018Additive\u2019 option, the anim system will take the weight of each additive layer into account and blend the layered animations accordingly. This is a great way to blend one animation on top of another.\\n\\n## Useful Links\\n\\nWe\u2019re really keen to see what you can create in PlayCanvas using this feature, so be sure to check out the links below so you can begin working with layer masks and blending.\\n\\n- [Anim Layer Masks User Manual](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/animation/anim-layer-masking/)\\n- [Anim Layer Blending User Manual](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/animation/anim-state-graph-assets/#layer-blending)\\n- [Layer Masks Engine Example](https://playcanvas.github.io/#/animation/layer-masks)"},{"id":"changes-to-our-editor-and-engine-releases","metadata":{"permalink":"/changes-to-our-editor-and-engine-releases","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2021-10-27-changes-to-our-editor-and-engine-releases.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-27-changes-to-our-editor-and-engine-releases.md","title":"Changes to our Editor and Engine Releases","description":"Up to now, our process for releasing new features and fixes to the PlayCanvas Engine and Editor has been rather simple.","date":"2021-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"editor","permalink":"/tags/editor"}],"readingTime":2.59,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Yau","title":"Partner Relations Manager","page":{"permalink":"/authors/steven"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/yaustar","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenyau/","github":"https://github.com/yaustar"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/yaustar.png","key":"steven"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"steven","slug":"changes-to-our-editor-and-engine-releases","title":"Changes to our Editor and Engine Releases","tags":["editor"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Anim Layer Masks and Blending","permalink":"/anim-layer-masks-and-blending"},"nextItem":{"title":"Import Full Model Hierarchy into PlayCanvas","permalink":"/import-full-model-hierarchy-into-playcanvas"}},"content":"Up to now, our process for releasing new features and fixes to the PlayCanvas Engine and Editor has been rather simple.\\n\\nAs features and fixes are ready, we would plan a release and test against a comprehensive list of PlayCanvas projects and the Engine examples.

This was subsequently used as the foundation for a new family of open source tools: the [glTF Viewer](https://playcanvas.com/viewer) and the [PlayCanvas Examples Browser](https://playcanvas.github.io/#/graphics/area-lights). However, some of our more recent tools projects have had requirements related to the creation and editing of node-based graphs. As a result, we set about developing a new plugin to PCUI called PCUI Graph. This plugin is already in use today since it powers both the PlayCanvas [Shader Editor](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/rfc-shader-editor/20616) and [Animation State Graph Editor](https://blog.playcanvas.com/introducing-the-anim-state-graph/):\\n\\n[![Graph Editors](/img/pcui-graph-editors.png)](/img/pcui-graph-editors.png)\\n\\nYou can rapidly map out key parts of your project\u2019s workflow using pcui-graph, as it supports both directed and visual programming graphs. Here are some of the key features that PCUI Graph provides:\\n\\n- **Schema based** - Each graph you create is based on a JSON formatted schema, allowing you to easily define the type of your graph up-front.\\n- **Event system** - You can hook up event listeners to any of the UI interactions made to a graph.\\n- **Graph state data** - Easily retrieve the current state of the graph in JSON data format at any time and this can be loaded back into the graph later.\\n- **Context menus** - You can define context menus in a graph schema, supporting the creation and deletion of nodes / edges in the UI.\\n\\n![Add Transition](/img/anim-state-graph-add-transition.png)\\n\\n- **Simple API** - Any of the user interactions with the graph can also be made programmatically.\\n- **Styling** - The graph can be configured to change the default styling of nodes / edges. These styles can also be overridden in the schema of each individual node / edge type.\\n\\n![PCUI Graph Styling](/img/pcui-graph-styled.png)\\n\\n## Useful links\\n\\n- [PCUI Graph GitHub homepage](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui-graph)\\n- [API documentation](https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui-graph/blob/master/docs/Graph.md)\\n\\nSo get started with PCUI and PCUI Graph today.

For example, with the new pipeline you can import a house FBX model and only use the door mesh instance in the scene instead of the whole model.\\n\\nHowever, please note that while the Model Component is compatible with both the Animation and Anim (State Graph) Component, the Render Component/Import Hierarchy feature is only compatible with the Anim (State Graph) Component.\\n\\n(More details will be shared in an upcoming announcement, stay tuned for that!)\\n\\nFor existing projects using the Model Component, please do not worry. **None of the existing functionality is being removed** and you will not be forced to update projects to the new pipeline for continued development. Although no new features will be added to the Model Component, the PlayCanvas team will continue to fix bugs with the existing pipeline.\\n\\nYou can even mix both pipelines in the same project if you wish to take advantage of the features in the new pipeline in an existing project. However, please bear in mind that this can add complexity to the project code.\\n\\nThe expected changes over the upcoming months are as follows:\\n\\n- Add/Rename a Project Setting to switch between the two mesh import pipelines (Currently, this is the \u2018Import Hierarchy\u2019 setting).\\n- Newly created projects will default to using the Render Component pipeline.\\n- [developer.playcanvas.com](https://developer.playcanvas.com) tutorials will be updated to use Render Component ([playcanvas.github.io](https://playcanvas.github.io) engine examples have already been updated).\\n- The template projects (Blank Project, Model Viewer Starter Kit, VR Starter Kit) will be updated to use Render Component.\\n- User Manual updates and mitigation steps from using the Model Component to Render Component pipelines.\\n\\n### Breaking change to PlayCanvas Fill Mode API\\n\\nWe want to make the PlayCanvas engine as flexible as it can be for the widest range of use cases for web developers. To do so, we occasionally have to break existing APIs that may have made sense when they were first introduced, but not today.\\n\\nOne such API is the Fill Mode related functions on `pc.Application`:\\n\\n- [`application.resizeCanvas`](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/blob/64668d98b6d8cd3ecba6ecae937f1ce50fed9707/src/framework/application.js#L1376)\\n- [`application.fillMode`](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/blob/64668d98b6d8cd3ecba6ecae937f1ce50fed9707/src/framework/application.js#L676)\\n- [`application.setCanvasFillMode`](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/blob/64668d98b6d8cd3ecba6ecae937f1ce50fed9707/src/framework/application.js#L1313)\\n\\nThese functions affect the canvas element size in the DOM as it was long assumed that apps made with PlayCanvas are either be iframed or fullscreen/full document apps.\\n\\nHowever, there has been more requests about having more control of the canvas element rather than using iframes. The main reason is that it\u2019s easier to communicate between the page and the PlayCanvas app without having to deal with iframe messaging.\\n\\nSome examples:\\n\\n- [Forum: A Complete PlayCanvas scene inside a div](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/a-complete-playcanvas-scene-inside-div-tags/18461)\\n- [Forum: PlayCanvas within a div](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/solved-playcanvas-within-a-div/10492)\\n- [Forum: Embedding PlayCanvas into a webpage without iframe](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/embedding-playcanvas-into-a-webpage-without-iframe/17246)\\n\\nCurrently, there is no way for an end user to have full control of the canvas without patching the engine.\\n\\nAlso, from an architecture point of view, the Engine shouldn\u2019t handle the size or position of the element that it is rendering in. The responsibility should be on the web document and how it wants to layout the elements on the page (e.g through stylesheets).\\n\\nThese changes will affect you directly if you are:\\n\\n- An engine only user as the HTML boilerplate will handle the resizing and positioning of the canvas. We will provide examples in the examples folder.\\n- Any developer that changes the fill mode or resizes the Canvas at runtime. Some developers do this to handle landscape and portrait mode more effectively.\\n\\nThe current plan is deprecate these functions and move them to globally accessible functions on the page on the PlayCanvas Editor environment with as little (if any) downtime for projects or developers. At worst, you should only get a few warnings in the console log regarding deprecated function use.\\n\\nThe steps will be as a gradual rollout:\\n\\n- Add globally accessible JS functions in the Editor and publish HTML templates to replace the fill mode functions from the Engine.\\n- Change the PlayCanvas Editor and published build templates to patch the Engine functions to call the global functions above with warnings that they should use the global functions instead.\\n- Update the User Manual to document these global functions.\\n- Deprecate the affected engine functions with warnings and reference the User Manual page.\\n\\n### Questions and Feedback\\n\\nIf there are any questions or areas that you would like to be made more clear, please post in the [forums](https://forum.playcanvas.com/) and the PlayCanvas team will be there to answer.\\n\\nThe PlayCanvas team are appreciative of your patience and continued support as we go through this transition!"},{"id":"introducing-the-anim-state-graph","metadata":{"permalink":"/introducing-the-anim-state-graph","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2021-05-05-introducing-the-anim-state-graph.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-05-05-introducing-the-anim-state-graph.md","title":"Introducing the Anim State Graph","description":"We\u2019re excited to be able to release a new system for creating fantastic and high fidelity animations in PlayCanvas!","date":"2021-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"animation","permalink":"/tags/animation"},{"inline":true,"label":"editor","permalink":"/tags/editor"},{"inline":true,"label":"workflow","permalink":"/tags/workflow"}],"readingTime":3.875,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Elliott Thompson","title":"Software Engineer","page":{"permalink":"/authors/elliott"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/elliott_thomps","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellt92/","github":"https://github.com/ellthompson"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/ellthompson.png","key":"elliott"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"elliott","slug":"introducing-the-anim-state-graph","title":"Introducing the Anim State Graph","tags":["animation","editor","workflow"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Transitioning to the New Render Component and Fill Mode API","permalink":"/transitioning-to-the-new-render-component-and-fill-mode-api"},"nextItem":{"title":"Build Facebook Playable Ads with PlayCanvas!","permalink":"/build-facebook-playable-ads-with-playcanvas"}},"content":"import ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to be able to release a new system for creating fantastic and high fidelity animations in PlayCanvas!\\n\\n[![](/img/animation-and-graph-2.gif)](/img/animation-and-graph-2.gif)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nAnimation systems receive a set of inputs (button presses, current player speed, health, etc) and output a model\'s animation pose for the current frame. How an animation system goes from a particular set of inputs to the desired animation pose can become quite complicated, especially when writing this in code.\\n\\n[![Animation Input and Outputs](/img/anim-inputs-and-outputs.png)](/img/anim-inputs-and-outputs.png)\\n\\nWith the release of the Anim component, Anim State Graph assets and Anim State Graph Editor, you will be able to design and develop intricate animation behavior for your game objects right in the PlayCanvas editor.\\n\\nIt\u2019s now easier than ever to make your game characters move just the way you\u2019d like, while writing minimal code in the process!\\n\\nHaving recently beta tested this feature with a number of developers, we\u2019ve already seen some fantastic results! For instance, the developer of the popular online shooter [venge.io](https://venge.io/) is utilizing the anim state graph to drive character animations in their up and coming online RPG.\\n\\nA clip of an early build of this game can be seen below, showcasing the blending of multiple animation clips. When combined together in a state graph they create realistic and fluid movement for the main character.\\n\\n![](/img/cem-prototype.gif)\\n\\nThis animation system was entirely developed in the PlayCanvas editor using the anim state graph user interface. The state graph for the main character can be seen below:\\n\\n![](/img/anim-state-graph.png)\\n\\nWe can\u2019t wait to see what other developers can create with this system!\\n\\n### Features\\n\\n**Graph Layers** - Split your animation behavior into separate layers. For instance: locomotion animations can be separated from facial expressions.\\n\\n**Multiple characters** - Because anim state graphs are stored as assets, a single graph can be used to drive the animation of as many entities as you want by assigning your graph asset to multiple entity anim components.\\n\\n![](/img/anim-state-graph-shared.gif)  \\n_Multiple characters utilizing the same anim state graph_\\n\\nWhile these two characters use different animations for their various actions, they share the same behavior. With the anim state graph you can update this behavior in one place while still using it with as many characters as you like.\\n\\n### How does it all work?\\n\\nWhen opening an Anim State Graph asset you\u2019ll be presented with a visual graph editor which allows you to define all of the different animation states your game object can be in. You can then connect these states using transitions.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/anim-create-state-graph.mp4\\" />\\n\\n_Create anim state graphs using the editor UI_\\n\\nEach transition blends between two animations over a specified amount of time. You can adjust and tweak transitions to your liking and see the results in real time in the PlayCanvas launch page. You can then assign parameter conditions to each transition to define the circumstances under which that transition can fire. These parameter values can be modified in your scripts to control the behavior of your animation system.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/anim-script-trigger.mp4\\" />\\n\\n_Control anim state graph behavior in scripts using the anim component API_\\n\\nOnce you\u2019ve created your Anim State Graph you can assign it to your entity using the Anim component. At this point you can attach your animation assets to each state which will play when transitioning to that state.\\n\\n### Looking Ahead\\n\\nToday only marks the initial release of our new animation system. We\u2019ve got grand plans on how to push the system further. Here\u2019s a few features we\u2019ve got in the works:\\n\\nAnimation Events - These events can be set up to fire and specific points during the lifetime of an animation, allowing you to hook game logic into the behavior of your anim state graph. For example you could spawn a set of dust particles during the exact frame that your character lands on the ground after a jump.\\n\\nLayer Masking - You\u2019ll be able mask your character animations on a particular state graph layer. For instance you could have only the bottom half of a character driven by a particular anim state graph layer.\\n\\nBlend Trees - Directly control the blend between multiple animations in real time.\\n\\n![](/img/anim-blend-trees.gif)  \\n_Blending three animations using a 2D cartesian blend tree_\\n\\nAnimation Clips - Currently the anim state graph supports animation assets that have been imported into PlayCanvas. Clips will allow you to create extra animation assets within the PlayCanvas editor yourself! These will be great for quickly adding smaller animated flourishes to your game objects.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re interested in using anim state graphs in your PlayCanvas projects, here\u2019s some useful links:\\n\\n- [User Manual](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/animation/)\\n- [Animation Blending Tutorial](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/anim-blending/)"},{"id":"build-facebook-playable-ads-with-playcanvas","metadata":{"permalink":"/build-facebook-playable-ads-with-playcanvas","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2021-03-25-build-facebook-playable-ads-with-playcanvas.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-25-build-facebook-playable-ads-with-playcanvas.md","title":"Build Facebook Playable Ads with PlayCanvas!","description":"Facebook Playable Ad","date":"2021-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"facebook","permalink":"/tags/facebook"},{"inline":true,"label":"ads","permalink":"/tags/ads"}],"readingTime":1.96,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Yau","title":"Partner Relations Manager","page":{"permalink":"/authors/steven"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/yaustar","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenyau/","github":"https://github.com/yaustar"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/yaustar.png","key":"steven"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"steven","slug":"build-facebook-playable-ads-with-playcanvas","title":"Build Facebook Playable Ads with PlayCanvas!","tags":["facebook","ads"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Introducing the Anim State Graph","permalink":"/introducing-the-anim-state-graph"},"nextItem":{"title":"WebGL Case Study: Rebuilding the Star-Lord PBR Demo","permalink":"/webgl-case-study-rebuilding-the-star-lord-pbr-demo"}},"content":"![Facebook Playable Ad](/img/facebook-playable-ad.gif)\\n\\nPlayCanvas are very excited to announce official support for Facebook Playable Ads! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### What are Playable Ads?\\n\\nPlayable ads are small, interactive previews of a game or app that give a taste of the experience before the user choses to download it.

So we decided to leverage all of the latest engine features and republish it.\\n\\nThe most significant improvements are related to load time. Let\'s start out by comparing some key stats:\\n\\n|                       | [Star-Lord 2014](https://playcanv.as/b/dCdIuibG/) | [Star-Lord 2021](https://playcanv.as/p/SA7hVBLt/) | % Change |\\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\\n| HTTP Requests         | 220                                               | 39                                                | \u2193 82.3%  |\\n| Preload Transfer (MB) | 10.1                                              | 5.6                                               | \u2193 44.6%  |\\n| Total Transfer (MB)   | 13.7                                              | 9.9                                               | \u2193 27.7%  |\\n| Total Resources (MB)  | 26.0                                              | 12.1                                              | \u2193 53.5%  |\\n| Load Time (s) \\\\*      | 1.8                                               | 1.2                                               | \u2193 33.3%  |\\n\\n_\\\\* Cache disabled on 100Gbps connection_\\n\\nThose are some pretty **_significant wins_**! So what are the differences between the two builds of the demo? Let\'s step through them one by one.\\n\\n### Convert JSON Meshes to GLB\\n\\nIn October 2020, [PlayCanvas officially switched](https://blog.playcanvas.com/faster-load-times-with-gltfs-glb-format/) from JSON to glTF 2.0 (GLB) for storing all model and animation data. While gzipped GLB is reasonably similar in size to gzipped JSON, it is up to an order of magnitude faster to parse a GLB file once it has been downloaded. Plus, a GLB file occupies less system memory than the equivalent JSON file. Converting all of the assets from JSON to GLB is a simple process. First, flip the project setting \'Convert to GLB\' in the \'Asset Tasks\' group to true:\\n\\n![Convert to GLB](/img/editor-convert-to-glb.png)\\n\\nNow, simply reupload all FBX files and a .glb asset will be generated rather than a .json asset. The last step is to use the Replace command in the right-click context menu to replace the .json asset with the .glb asset (plus any materials as well).\\n\\n![Switch from JSON to GLB](/img/editor-json-to-glb.gif)\\n\\nYou can then delete the old JSON asset (plus any unreferenced related materials).\\n\\n### Basis Compress Textures\\n\\nLast month, [we announced](https://blog.playcanvas.com/basis-texture-compression-arrives-in-playcanvas/) the integration of Basis texture compression into the Editor. Star-Lord was originally configured to use DXT, PVR and ETC compressed textures. A download size comparison is as follows:\\n\\n| Texture Format | Download Size (MB) |\\n| -------------- | ------------------ |\\n| DXT            | 7.56               |\\n| PVR            | 6.09               |\\n| ETC1           | 7.18               |\\n| Basis          | 2.38               |\\n\\nThis explains much of the download savings in the updated version.\\n\\nFortunately, applying Basis compression to the app\'s textures is literally a two-click operation:\\n\\n[![Compress Basis](/img/editor-compress-basis.gif)](/img/editor-compress-basis.gif)\\n\\n### Prefilter Cubemaps in the Editor\\n\\nWhen PBR first arrived in PlayCanvas, the Editor could not prefilter cubemaps. This conversion had to be performed externally with RGBM format cubemap faces being added to the Editor:\\n\\n[![Cubemap Faces](/img/prefiltered-cubemap-faces.png)](/img/prefiltered-cubemap-faces.png)\\n\\nEach cubemap had 6 mip levels with 6 faces for each level. And with 5 different cubemaps, that meant 180 of the demo\'s 220 HTTP requests were for these PNGs!\\n\\nThese days, the Editor makes is super easy to import 6 HDR cubemap faces, build a cubemap and then prefilter it.\\n\\n[![Prefilter Cubemap](/img/editor-prefilter-cubemap.gif)](/img/editor-prefilter-cubemap.gif)\\n\\nSo instead of loading 180 PNGs, the demo now loads just 5 DDS files. Much faster. \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n### Asynchronously Load Assets\\n\\nTo achieve an optimal load time, it is important to only load what is required to make your app functional. It is arguable that music is not strictly a necessary precondition for your app to start. Therefore, the demo now asynchronously loads the mp3 asset that contains the music track and auto-plays it as soon as it is downloaded. It is 3.9MB which accounts for nearly 40% of the app\'s payload! So be sure to carefully audit your app for assets that can be streamed instead of preloaded.\\n\\nRead more about preloading and streaming of assets in the [User Manual](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/assets/preloading-and-streaming/).\\n\\n### Useful Links\\n\\n- [Star-Lord Project](https://playcanvas.com/project/333626/overview/starlord)\\n- [Star-Lord App](https://playcanv.as/p/SA7hVBLt/)\\n- [User Manual: Optimizing Load Time](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/optimization/load-time/)\\n- [User Manual: Physically Based Rendering](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/graphics/physical-rendering/)"},{"id":"basis-texture-compression-arrives-in-playcanvas","metadata":{"permalink":"/basis-texture-compression-arrives-in-playcanvas","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2021-01-06-basis-texture-compression-arrives-in-playcanvas.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-01-06-basis-texture-compression-arrives-in-playcanvas.md","title":"Basis Texture Compression arrives in PlayCanvas","description":"PlayCanvas implemented the fantastic hardware texture compression workflow in 2016 which allowed users to build bigger and better WebGL apps, even on low memory devices like mobile phones.","date":"2021-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"compression","permalink":"/tags/compression"},{"inline":true,"label":"editor","permalink":"/tags/editor"},{"inline":true,"label":"performance","permalink":"/tags/performance"}],"readingTime":2.575,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Yau","title":"Partner Relations Manager","page":{"permalink":"/authors/steven"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/yaustar","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenyau/","github":"https://github.com/yaustar"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/yaustar.png","key":"steven"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"steven","slug":"basis-texture-compression-arrives-in-playcanvas","title":"Basis Texture Compression arrives in PlayCanvas","tags":["compression","editor","performance"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"WebGL Case Study: Rebuilding the Star-Lord PBR Demo","permalink":"/webgl-case-study-rebuilding-the-star-lord-pbr-demo"},"nextItem":{"title":"PCUI 1.1.0 Adds Tree Control and Array Control","permalink":"/pcui-1-1-0-adds-tree-control-and-array-control"}},"content":"PlayCanvas implemented the fantastic hardware texture compression [workflow in 2016](https://blog.playcanvas.com/webgl-texture-compression-made-easy/#more-2426) which allowed users to build bigger and better WebGL apps, even on low memory devices like mobile phones.\\n\\nJPGs and PNGs are great formats for transmission over a network because they tend to compress nicely. But once the images are downloaded and handed over to WebGL, they must decompressed to raw RGB(A) data. Using hardware compressed textures is important as decompression is performed in silicon on the GPU which avoids the need to utilize lots of memory.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThis 4096 x 2048 Earth texture is a 1.81MB JPG but takes a huge **33.6MB of VRAM** when uncompressed!\\n\\n![Earth Texture](/img/texture-earth.jpg)\\n\\nWith hardware supported texture formats, we can retain a similar file size while massively reducing the amount of VRAM as seen below.\\n\\n![Legacy Texture Compression](/img/editor-legacy-texture-compression.png)\\n\\n**Now, what if you reduce file sizes _as well as_ the VRAM usage?!**\\n\\nThat is what Basis gives us and it is available right now to all PlayCanvas users!

This means that there is only **a single (and often smaller) file** that is created to support a wide range of platforms.\\n\\nAs shown by the numbers above, Basis offers huge savings in download times for the end user which in turn, can lead to improved user engagement and click to open metrics for your application.\\n\\nLet\u2019s check out a real world example. The _Space Base Texture Compression Demo_ from our previous blog article achieves the following VRAM usage and download sizes (gzipped) on desktop in Chrome:\\n\\n![Texture Compression Comparison](/img/texture-compression-comparison.jpg)\\n\\n![Texture VRAM Usage](/img/texture-vram-usage.png)\\n\\nNote that VRAM usage for Basis would ordinarily be the same as with legacy compression. However, PlayCanvas compresses normal maps to YYYX format instead of XYZ for improved quality so utilization is marginally higher.\\n\\n![Texture Download Size](/img/texture-download-size.png)\\n\\nThat\u2019s a **big saving of 52% (19.5 MB)** in download size from updating the project to use Basis while using a similar amount of VRAM!\\n\\nAnd all it takes is a couple of clicks in the asset inspector to get started with Basis compression!\\n\\n![Enable Basis](/img/editor-enable-basis.gif)\\n\\n### To Recap\\n\\n- **Only need one compressed file** vs many (DXT, PVR, ETC1, ETC2, etc) for every texture\\n- **Up to 2.8 times smaller files** and faster download times for your users\\n- **Up to 10x faster compression times with Basis**\\n- **Similar savings in VRAM usage** as hardware supported formats\\n- **Same one click process** to compress textures\\n\\nBasis texture compression is **available to everyone** right now so start crunching down those textures!

Since then, the JavaScript language and the surrounding tools ecosystem has moved on considerably. But PlayCanvas has steadfastly stuck to ES5. Why? Internet Explorer 11.\\n\\nIE11 was released on October 17, 2013. But even today, [StatCounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201905-202005) reports that IE11 has 2.43% of the global desktop browser market. Since PlayCanvas content is viewed by 100s of millions of end users, this is a pretty big deal.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nOver time, the engine codebase has grown significantly. It\'s now nearly 100,000 lines long. Maintaining and building such a large codebase can be problematic. To help bring some level of consistency and structure, we imposed the following pattern:\\n\\n```javascript\\nObject.assign(pc, (function () {\\n    var SomeClass = function () {\\n        this.other = new pc.OtherClass();\\n    };\\n\\n    Object.assign(SomeClass.prototype, {\\n        someFunction: function () {}\\n    });\\n\\n    return {\\n        SomeClass: SomeClass\\n    };\\n}()));\\n```\\n\\n`pc` is the PlayCanvas library namespace. So a developer would create instances of this class as follows:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar thing = new pc.SomeClass();\\n```\\n\\nTo build the engine, we wrote a node.js script which would parse a list of dependencies (JavaScript filenames) and concatenate them. There were several problems:\\n\\n1. The pattern above is overly verbose making it harder to inspect the code.\\n2. `Object.assign` needs to be called 250 times when the library is initially executed by the browser, once for each module. This increases app start-up times.\\n3. In internal engine code, all class names and constants need to be accessed via the `pc` namespace. This is because the internals of the pattern above cannot see the internals of other modules and vice versa. This bloats the engine code and slows things down.\\n4. The dependencies file had to be carefully manually ordered to ensure things were declared in the right order.\\n5. The build script itself was about 1000 lines of JavaScript which carried its own maintenance overhead.\\n6. Unused code was being included in the published engine.\\n\\nWe believed the solution to these problems was to migrate the engine codebase from vanilla ES5 to ES6 modules. This would transform the original module pattern to:\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport { OtherClass } from \'./other-class.js\';\\n\\nvar SomeClass = function () {\\n    this.other = new OtherClass();\\n};\\n\\nObject.assign(SomeClass.prototype, {\\n    someFunction: function () {}\\n});\\n\\nexport { SomeClass };\\n```\\n\\nMuch better!\\n\\n- No more needless calls to Object.assign to the pc namespace.\\n- No further need to use the pc namespace within modules.\\n- Dependencies are explicitly described in each JS file.\\n- Only what is necessary is exported from modules (and the overall engine).\\n\\nBut what about IE11? It doesn\'t understand ES6 module syntax! \ud83d\ude31 PlayCanvas still needs to ship as a strictly ES5 library. To transform the entire codebase from ES6 module format to ES5 UMD format (PlayCanvas is used in both the browser and Node), you simply need to leverage a JavaScript bundler.\\n\\nThere are many options for selecting a JS bundler. In the end, 3 options were tested: Rollup, Parcel and ESBuild. You can see the PRs for each here:\\n\\n- Rollup: [https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/2166](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/2166)\\n- Parcel: [https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/2106](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/2106)\\n- ESBuild: [https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/2115](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/2115)\\n\\nIn the end, Rollup was selected over Parcel and ESBuild. In testing, Parcel needed up to 16s for an initial build, while Rollup only required 3s. And we were reticent to adopt ESBuild since it was far less established and battle tested compared to Rollup. But we may review this decision in the future. Now that the engine is ported to ES6 modules, switching bundler is fairly straightforward.\\n\\nWith Rollup, the build script reduced from ~1000 lines to ~100 lines. Quite a saving. Rollup\'s plugin system made it incredibly easy to write custom handling for GLSL files and also run a C-like preprocessor in order to build debug, release and profile versions of the engine.\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nNow that we have merged the ES6 Module port, where do we go from here?\\n\\nFirst up, Rollup is kindly informing us that circular dependencies exist in the PlayCanvas codebase.\\n\\n![Rollup Circular Dependencies](/img/engine-circular-dependencies.png)\\n\\nWe want to clean things up and eliminate them. What\'s the motivation for that? It makes it easier for the bundler to employ tree-shaking to remove unreferenced code from the engine. At the moment, the engine\'s `Application` class imports pretty much everything. And many classes import the `Application`. This makes it hard to build a version of the library which doesn\'t include the particle engine, say. Or maybe the physics engine.\\n\\nBeyond that, we are keen to explore leaving ES5 behind and fully embracing \'modern\' JavaScript, or maybe TypeScript. Rollup can trivially run Babel or the TypeScript compiler as plugins, thereby ensuring we can still ship an ES5 library. We\'re looking forward to making that decision based on your feedback.

Eventually, we may make the type of the internal dynamics world selectable, or maybe even allow multiple worlds to be created, but for now, this is how the demo was structured.\\n\\n**_Step 2: Implement CPU skinning_**\\n\\nPlayCanvas performs all skinning on the GPU. However we need skinned positions on CPU to update the soft body anchors ([btSoftBody::Anchor](https://pybullet.org/Bullet/BulletFull/structbtSoftBody_1_1Anchor.html)) to match the character\'s animation. CPU skinning may be supported in future PlayCanvas releases.\\n\\n**_Step 3: Patch shaders to support composite simulated and non-simulated mesh rendering_**\\n\\nSoft body meshes will generate vertex positions and normal data in world space, so in order to render the dynamically simulated (cloth) parts of character meshes correctly, we have to patch in support by overriding the current PlayCanvas [vertex transform shader chunk](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/blob/main/src/scene/shader-lib/chunks/common/vert/transform.js). In a final implementation, no patching should be necessary, as we would probably add in-built support for composite simulated and non-simulated mesh rendering.\\n\\n**_Step 4: Implement render meshes to soft body meshes conversion_**\\n\\nPlayCanvas character meshes cannot be used directly by the soft body mesh creation functions ([btSoftBodyHelpers::CreateFromTriMesh](https://pybullet.org/Bullet/BulletFull/structbtSoftBodyHelpers.html#a272cdc7d6d2ad911550d823419bdd3e7)) and so require some conversion, so the PlayCanvas [vertex iterator](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/blob/main/src/platform/graphics/vertex-iterator.js) was used to access and convert the mesh data. Eventually this conversion could be done on asset import into the PlayCanvas editor.\\n\\n**_Step 5: Implement per-bone attachments_**\\n\\nPlayCanvas currently doesn\'t have a way to attach objects to specific character bones via the Editor (it\'s on our roadmap for the coming months!). Therefore, per-bone attachments was implemented in order to attach simplified rigid body colliders to different parts of the character to prevent the cloth from intersecting the character mesh. We are using simplified colliders instead of trying to use the full skinned character mesh because it runs much faster.\\n\\nIf you are feeling adventurous, you can find the prototype source code for the example above in this PlayCanvas project:\\n\\n[https://playcanvas.com/project/691109/overview/cloth-simulation-demo](https://playcanvas.com/project/691109/overview/cloth-simulation-demo)\\n\\nIt is a prototype implementation and so expect many changes (some of which are mentioned above) in a final implementation.\\n\\nWant to try soft body dynamics on your own character? Here\'s how:\\n\\n**_Step 1: Fork the [PlayCanvas prototype project](https://playcanvas.com/project/691109/overview/cloth-simulation-demo)._**\\n\\n**_Step 2: Mark out what parts of the character you want simulated:_**\\n\\nThis is done by painting colors into the character mesh vertices - the example character was downloaded from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/), and imported into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/):\\n\\n[![](/img/cloth-simulation-painted-vertices-1.jpg)](/img/cloth-simulation-painted-vertices-1.jpg)\\n\\n[![](/img/cloth-simulation-painted-vertices-2.jpg)](/img/cloth-simulation-painted-vertices-2.jpg)Black = fully simulated, White = not simulated\\n\\n**_Step 3: Import the character into the PlayCanvas editor and set up collision:_**\\n\\n[![](/img/cloth-simulation-collision-1.jpg)](/img/cloth-simulation-collision-1.jpg)\\n\\n[![](/img/cloth-simulation-collision-2.jpg)](/img/cloth-simulation-collision-2.jpg)\\n\\nOn this character, only colliders for the legs and body are needed.\\n\\n### What\'s Next?\\n\\nWe are really excited about developing this technology in the coming months. We will focus on these areas:\\n\\n- Take learnings from the prototype and add good support for soft body dynamics in PlayCanvas\\n- Create easy to use tools for PlayCanvas developers to import and setup characters with soft body dynamics\\n- Further optimize and improve quality\\n\\nWe would love to get your thoughts and feedback so come join the conversation on the [PlayCanvas forum](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/how-to-implement-cloth-simulation-with-playcanvas/13484)!"},{"id":"a-new-ui-for-the-playcanvas-editor","metadata":{"permalink":"/a-new-ui-for-the-playcanvas-editor","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2020-05-14-a-new-ui-for-the-playcanvas-editor.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-05-14-a-new-ui-for-the-playcanvas-editor.md","title":"A New UI for the PlayCanvas Editor","description":"The PlayCanvas Editor has been around since 2011.

If you think it looks retro now, it actually looked retro then! But you can more or less recognize it as PlayCanvas. The Pack Explorer is now the Hierarchy panel on the left. The Attribute Editor is now the Inspector. You can even see the \'Who\'s Online\' bar to the bottom right, which is still around today. We decided quite quickly to drop the WinXP aesthetic by adopting a darker theme in September 2013:\\n\\n[![](/img/designer-extjs-dark.png)](/img/designer-extjs-dark.png)\\n\\nThis refresh was definitely an improvement and it was the start of the Designer finding a personality of its own. But after this, the team was struggling to iterate quickly. We took the very difficult decision to throw away the entire ExtJS-based Designer application and rewrite it from scratch using the incredible [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) framework. And thus, by early 2015, the PlayCanvas Editor was born:\\n\\n[![](/img/editor-new-car.png)](/img/editor-new-car.png)\\n\\nThis initial version of the Editor should be much more recognizable. The toolbar and panels are all still in the same location. But today, the Editor packs in far more functionality and is much more powerful.\\n\\nIt was originally written in ES5 and a subset of CSS that would enable the Editor to work in browsers all the way back to IE11. Late last year, we embarked on the next major overhaul for the Editor, with the following goals:\\n\\n- Create a clean, structured underlying Editor API (more on this later)\\n- Adopt ES6 (let\'s get with the times!)\\n- Adopt CSS grid to make managing the Editor\'s layout easier\\n- Refresh and refine the front-end design\\n\\nWe\'ve slowly been phasing in the new front-end over the last several months, first deploying an updated Hierarchy Panel and then a new Inspector Panel. Today, we\'re proud to announce the final step in the rollout - the new Asset Panel:\\n\\n[![](/img/editor-new-casino.png)](/img/editor-new-casino.png)\\n\\nTo the end user, the most obvious change is the addition of the Asset Panel\'s Details View. As an alternative to thumbnails, you can now see a linear list of assets and even sort them on size and type.\\n\\n![](/img/detailsview.gif)\\n\\nWe expect that this will rapidly become the default view for most PlayCanvas developers. No more mouse hovering to read long filenames!\\n\\nSo what\'s next? Earlier, I mentioned that this completely rebuilt Editor front-end is built on a new, clean, object-oriented API. It is our plan to release this API publicly, once it is ready. This will enable you to write extensions and customizations to the Editor that will culminate in a full plugin system. Stay tuned for further details of that.

In the early days, we were essentially prototyping, seeing what this amazing new WebGL API could do. By October 2011, we set up a source code repository and [committed our first engine prototype](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/commit/e5bf014e). Right at the beginning, we adopted [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)\xa0for naming our releases. Our initial commit generated [engine v0.10.0](https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-0.10.0.js). From that point onwards, we adopted a rapid release cadence, often publishing more than one release a week. The months and years passed, our team grew and feature after feature was integrated into the codebase. But through all that time, we never incremented the major version number. Why? Well, there were several reasons.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n1. Our rapid deployment meant we never delivered a monster release that seemed to warrant going to 1.0.0.\\n\\n2. We always made a huge effort to maintain backwards compatibility. Projects like the inane [Doom3: Gangnam Style](https://playcanvas.com/project/23/overview/doom3-gangnam-style) created in December 2011 still work fine today! So we never (intentionally) break your projects.\\n\\n3. We, uh, just never got around to it!\\n\\nThe semantic versioning site says:\\n\\n> How do I know when to release 1.0.0? If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be 1.0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should be 1.0.0. If you\u2019re worrying a lot about backwards compatibility, you should probably already be 1.0.0.\\n\\nThe PlayCanvas API is now very stable, mature and battle-hardened. Backwards compatibility is something we take very seriously indeed. And today, PlayCanvas is used in production by thousands of developers.\\n\\n![Indian Motorcycles](/img/indian-motorcycles.png)\\n_[Indian Motorcycle\'s PlayCanvas-powered configurator](https://www.indianmotorcycle.com/en-us/build-color/?selectedmodel=cruiser&CatalogContentId=724000__CatalogContent)_\\n\\nAnd so, it gives me great pleasure to announce [PlayCanvas Engine v1.0.0](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

We knew that Flash would still be around for some years, but we also knew that building any replacement for content creators would be a titanic task. Over six years later, PlayCanvas has established itself as the go-to toolset for building WebGL-content. The browser-based Editor application is lightweight yet exceptionally powerful. The apps produced are super-lightweight and perform great even on older mobile devices. And our modern, cloud-based approach enables developers to collaborate and iterate like never before.\\n\\n![PlayCanvas Editor](/img/editor-after-the-flood-tree.png)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nFlash never did quite manage to establish Stage3D as a standard. WebGL, on the other hand, has cemented itself as the dominant force for web-based 3D, and has now reached version 2.0. In fact, [PlayCanvas partnered with Mozilla](https://blog.playcanvas.com/mozilla-launches-webgl-2-with-playcanvas/) back in January to launch the new standard. Flash has always been more popular for 2D based content and the remaining Flash developers must now find a path to migrate away. Spoiler alert: we\'re working hard on improving our support for 2D. While it\'s possible to make superb 2D content with PlayCanvas today (check out [Master Archer](https://playcanv.as/p/JERg21J8/), one of the top titles on Facebook Instant Games), we recognize there\'s still more to be done in both the engine and the tools.

So what\'s new?\\n\\nWe\'ve added a brand new level. We\'ve moved away from the \'TRON\' style graphics and adopted a more realistic style. Beautiful, I hope you\'ll agree.\\n\\n[![TANX](/img/tanx-new.jpg)](/img/tanx-new.jpg)\\n\\nAll power ups have been lovingly remodeled.\\n\\n![TANX Powerups](/img/tanx-powerups.jpg)\\n\\nWe\'ve added a very sexy shield effect. See it crackle with energy as it kicks in. All done in a special custom GLSL shader.\\n\\n![TANX Shield](/img/tanx-shield.gif)\\n\\nTo turn up the mayhem, we\'ve added camera shake and punchy explosions, built with PlayCanvas\' particle system component.\\n\\n![TANX Explosions](/img/tanx-boom.gif)\\n\\nThe game even has a new URL. Play now at:\\n\\n#### [https://tanx.io](https://tanx.io)\\n\\n> \u26a0\ufe0f **Public Service Announcement:** TANX is highly addictive. Please take occasional breaks!\\n\\nCan you believe this game is playable after loading just 2.8MB of data? Massive fun delivered to your browser in seconds.\\n\\nWe hope you love this update.

This update benefits from 2 years of Emscripten improvements and exposes much more of the Bullet API. So if you are feeling adventurous, you can delve into the parts of Ammo that PlayCanvas does not expose and try some more advanced physics effects. For example, soft body physics. Or maybe utilize constraints for things like ragdolls, as shown below:\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"/img/ragdoll.mp4\\" />\\n\\nWant to check out the project above?

But for\xa0a feature as complex as virtual reality, browser support is only one piece of the puzzle. At PlayCanvas, we know how important\xa0great tools are to making high quality experiences so today we\'re launching our WebVR engine integration to make sure that you can create applications\xa0right now.\\n\\n## PlayCanvas WebVR\\n\\n### Optimized Engine Support\\n\\nThe PlayCanvas graphics engine is an\xa0advanced WebGL graphics engine. We\'ve worked hard to make sure our renderer is optimized specifically for stereo rendering. Unlike most engines we don\'t simply render the scene twice for each eye.\xa0Instead, our renderer knows\xa0that a lot of the main render loop is the same for each eye. So, for example, expensive operations like culling, sorting draw calls and setting\xa0uniforms and render states only have to be done once before we draw the scene for each eye. This can lead to a significant performance increase, particularly on mobile.\\n\\n![VR Performance Comparison](/img/vr-comparison-1.jpg)\\n\\n### Polyfill for unsupported platforms\\n\\nIt\'s still early days for WebVR which means it\'s not yet supported on all platforms. When you enable WebVR in your PlayCanvas project, we make sure your browser can support it using the [WebVR polyfill](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill) library from Google. PlayCanvas is smart enough to load the library only if you need it.\\n\\n### Tutorials and Documentation\\n\\nPlayCanvas is renowned for its extensive documentation and VR is no different. [Basic instructions](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/xr/vr/), [API reference](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/XrManager.html) and [specific optimization tips](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/xr/optimizing-webxr/), we\'ve got it all.\\n\\n### Samples and Starter Kits\\n\\nThese sample projects show\xa0you how to construct a VR scene and give you sample code to start from.\\n\\n[Hello World](https://playcanvas.com/project/433339/overview/webvr-hello-world) - A very simple 3D scene\\n\\n[360 Image](https://playcanvas.com/project/434266/overview/webvr-360-image) - Just drop in your own 360 panorama\\n\\n[360 Video](https://playcanvas.com/project/434444/overview/webvr-360-video) -\xa0Add a link to your own video\\n\\n[Room Scale VR](https://playcanvas.com/project/434546/overview/webvr-orange-room) - A more complex scene designed for HTC Vive and other Room Scale VR\\n\\n### The Future\\n\\nWe believe the future for WebVR is very bright and we\'re committed to making\xa0PlayCanvas the\xa0best tool for creating WebVR applications.

PlayCanvas is excited to introduce\xa0**easy texture compression**, enabling you to build bigger and better WebGL apps.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nToday, the vast majority of WebGL developers load textures from JPG and PNG images. Unfortunately, while these formats compress well for transmission (especially JPG), they occupy a great deal of video memory when passed to WebGL. For example, let\'s consider this image of the Earth:\\n\\n\x3c!-- more --\x3e\\n\\n[![Earth Texture](/img/texture-earth.jpg)](/img/texture-earth.jpg)\\n\\nThe image is 4096\xa0by 2048 but compresses well to a 1.81MB JPG file. Under the hood, WebGL expands this image to uncompressed 24-bit RGB, using 33.6MB of VRAM! Now imagine a single material with diffuse, normal, metalness, gloss, emissive and opacity maps. 6 of these images will occupy over 200MB of VRAM. Now imagine having 10 or more unique materials in your app. Get ready for crashed browser tabs and unhappy end users!\\n\\nWebGL solves this problem by providing support for a number of\xa0compressed texture formats supported in hardware on the GPU. Each GPU tends to support at least one of these formats. Today, WebGL has fairly widespread support for:\\n\\n- DXT: supported by all desktop devices\xa0and some Android devices\\n- PVR: supported by all iOS devices and some Android devices\\n- ETC1: supported by most Android devices\\n\\nPlayCanvas exposes these formats through a simple inspector panel on a texture asset. For the Earth\xa0image, it gives the following results:\\n\\n[![compressiondialog](/img/compressiondialog.png)](/img/compressiondialog.png)\\n\\nThe first number is the GZIPed file size and the second number denotes how much VRAM is occupied by the texture. Notice how the compressed images occupy one sixth\xa0of the VRAM when compared to the original JPG. This is a stunning reduction!\\n\\nLet\'s turn out attention to the demo iframed at the top of this article. VRAM usage is as follows:\\n\\n| Texture Set | VRAM Usage (MB) |\\n| ----------- | --------------- |\\n| JPG + PNG   | 528.0           |\\n| DXT         | 87.7            |\\n| PVR         | 66.8            |\\n| ETC1        | 87.7            |\\n\\nTexture compression suddenly makes the demo mobile friendly. But notice how it loads incredibly quickly after loading a mere 4MB of data. How is this possible? The textures are using a technique called level of detail, where low resolution versions are loaded up front allowing the application to start, while the high resolution versions asynchronously stream in the background. Also note that the app doesn\'t have to load any lightmaps because they are created procedurally on application start\xa0using [PlayCanvas\' runtime lightmap generation](https://blog.playcanvas.com/runtime-lightmap-generation-for-webgl/).\\n\\nPlayCanvas\' approach ensures that the most optimal texture format is selected for the device on which your application is running. In contrast, the Unity WebGL solution\xa0loads DDS files and decompresses as necessary on platforms that don\'t support it. This means that mobile devices do not benefit\xa0despite mobile devices having the greatest need for compression.\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\n- **One-click texture compression** for DXT, PVR and ETC1\\n- Achieve at least **6 times compression** of all texture data in your WebGL apps\\n- **Most optimal image format selected** for device running a PlayCanvas app\\n\\nPlayCanvas Texture Compression is available from today for Organization and Personal account holders ([see the manual](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/assets/textures/#texture-compression) for more info). It will be rolled out to all users following a short beta period. So go forth, compress your textures and take your WebGL apps to a whole new level.

So it would be reasonable to expect Unreal to suffer from the same issues as Unity: large download sizes, long load times and poor runtime performance.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWe could do the same experiments as before with the textured cube, but let\'s try to make a more real-world comparison. Flappy Bird clones have been made in both Unreal and PlayCanvas. Let\'s take the Epic-authored Tappy Chicken and see how it fares against the PlayCanvas-powered Flappy Bird. Here\'s the \xa0(playable) PlayCanvas game:\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://playcanv.as/b/ONc0qGvZ/\\" title=\\"360 lookaround camera\\" webkitallowfullscreen=\\"true\\" mozallowfullscreen=\\"true\\" allow=\\"autoplay\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\" allowvr=\\"\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\nUnfortunately, I can\'t embed Tappy Chicken because Epic have restricted it to desktop browsers. So [here\'s a link](https://www.unrealengine.com/html5/) to it, along with an animated GIF:\\n\\n[![tappychicken](/img/tappychicken.gif)](/img/tappychicken.gif)\\n\\nSo before we begin, there\'s an important point to make. _They are not the same game and they do exhibit certain differences_. Tappy Chicken uses different textures, has parallax, uses particles and so on.\xa0But in essence, they are remarkably similar and worthy of a comparison, despite not being pixel perfect clones of each other. It\'s up to you, dear reader, to decide if the differences in the games account for the results of the analysis presented below.\\n\\nAs before, we will look at three key metrics: download size, load time and runtime performance.\\n\\n### Download Size\\n\\nTo check the download size of each app, we disabled the cache in Chrome Dev Tools and recorded the total transfer:\\n\\n| Tappy Chicken (Unreal) | Flappy Bird (PlayCanvas) |\\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |\\n| 10.0MB                 | 0.22MB                   |\\n\\n**Epic\'s game is over 47 times larger than the PlayCanvas game.** Again, we see an Emscripten dependent engine struggle with download size. Just [the JavaScript of Tappy Chicken](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/TappyChicken/gameFiles_1408053316/UE4Game-HTML5-Shipping.js.jgz) accounts for 7.3MB of the entire 10MB payload, and that is the GZIPped size. Uncompressed, it is over 36MB of JavaScript. PlayCanvas\' hand-written, \'JavaScript-first\' approach wins out here, with a tiny 147KB footprint (615KB uncompressed) for the entire engine.\\n\\n### Load Time\\n\\nUnfortunately, Epic prevents Tappy Chicken from running on mobile so we\'ll just test load times on desktop. For the test, we\'ll use a Core i7-powered Win10 machine on a 50Mb/s connection to the net. The browser cache has been disabled.\\n\\n| Browser    | Tappy Chicken (Unreal) | Flappy Bird (PlayCanvas) |\\n| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |\\n| Chrome 52  | 15.8s                  | 0.9s                     |\\n| Firefox 48 | 11.0s                  | 1.4s                     |\\n| Edge 14    | 23.6s                  | 1.1s                     |\\n\\nThe PlayCanvas game was also run on a number of mobile devices and always runs at 60Hz and loaded in under 2 seconds.\\n\\nThings to notice:\\n\\n- **Chrome loads the PlayCanvas game 17.6 times faster than the Unreal game.** Other browsers show impressive multiples too.\\n- Firefox loads the asm.js-based Unreal runtime the fastest. Since Emscripten is a Mozilla technology and Firefox is heavily optimized for asm.js code, this is not a great surprise.\\n- Load times appear to depend on more than just loading the game files. Preprocessing 36MB of JavaScript also contributes to the slow Unreal load times.\\n\\n### Runtime Performance\\n\\nTo analyze runtime performance, let\'s compare captures of the two games using the Timeline panel in Chrome Dev Tools. Here\'s a capture for the PlayCanvas-powered Flappy Bird showing a frame executed in 0.57ms:\\n\\n[![flappy_timeline](/img/flappy_timeline.png)](/img/flappy_timeline.png)\\n\\nAnd here\'s a capture for the Unreal-powered Tappy Chicken with a frame executed in 5.0ms:\\n\\n[![tappy_timeline](/img/tappy_timeline-1.png)](/img/tappy_timeline-1.png)\\n\\nIn each capture, a typical frame has been selected. Not the fastest, not the slowest. Just an \'average\' frame. Note that both captures are showing a frame at the same timeline scale.\\n\\nThings to notice:\\n\\n- **CPU load in the Unreal game is typically around 8x greater than for the PlayCanvas game.**\xa0Taking\xa0the \'Composite Layers\' step of the browser into account (green bar in the Timeline captures), the multiple is closer to 6x. So although both games generally lock to 60Hz on the test hardware, the PlayCanvas game can process a frame well within a millisecond whereas the Unreal game is clearly stressing the CPU. On lower end hardware, the Unreal game would become CPU bound.\\n- CPU load is much more variable in the Unreal game and spikes regularly. Without understanding the internals of the Unreal engine, it is hard to explain this. But the result is sporadic\xa0frame drops.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nTo summarize:\\n\\n- **Epic\'s game is over 47 times larger than the PlayCanvas game.**\\n- **Chrome loads the PlayCanvas game 17.6 times faster than the Unreal game.**\\n- **CPU load in the Unreal game is typically around 8x greater than for the PlayCanvas game.**\\n\\nTo be fair, Epic say the following in their documentation:\\n\\n> The HTML5 pipeline is currently experimental. Some projects may not run properly when built for the HTML5 platform. Expect some rough edges.\\n\\nBut we clearly see here that Unreal suffers similar problems to Unity\'s WebGL exporter. Export sizes are huge, load times are long and runtime performance is poor when compared to a \'WebGL-first\' engine like PlayCanvas.\\n\\nTo learn how PlayCanvas built an engine so optimized for the browser, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine) to explore the open sourced runtime.

So let\'s examine this in a blog post.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nBut first, let me quickly introduce Unity and PlayCanvas to the uninitiated. Unity is a game engine provided as a native, desktop application for Windows, Mac and Linux.\xa0PlayCanvas is an HTML5/WebGL game engine that is provided as a web application that runs in any browser on any operating system.\\n\\nFor the purpose of this article, we\'re keeping things simple. We\'ve created the \'Hello World\' of apps in both Unity 5.3.2 and PlayCanvas: a spinning, textured cube:\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://playcanv.as/b/5bLMNnvC/\\" title=\\"360 lookaround camera\\" webkitallowfullscreen=\\"true\\" mozallowfullscreen=\\"true\\" allow=\\"autoplay\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\" allowvr=\\"\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\nThe application above is the PlayCanvas app. I\'m not embedding\xa0the Unity app since it can crash the page (if you\'re feeling brave, click [here](http://unity-comparison.playcanvas.com/perf1e/unity/index.html) to run it in a new tab).\\n\\nWe decided to look at 3 key metrics: download size, load time and frame rate.\\n\\n### Download Size\\n\\nTo check the download size of each app, we disabled the cache in Chrome Dev Tools and recorded the total transfer:\\n\\n| Unity  | PlayCanvas |\\n| ------ | ---------- |\\n| 4.72MB | 0.22MB     |\\n\\n**The Unity app is over 21 times larger than the PlayCanvas app**. How is this possible? The PlayCanvas engine is a miniscule 147KB when GZIPped meaning the code and assets for the app account for the remaining 73KB. The engine is so small because it is hand-crafted in JavaScript, relying on as much functionality as possible from the browser itself.\\n\\nUnity, on the other hand, relies on Emscripten to export to WebGL. This tool auto-converts C# code to C++, which in turn is compiled to LLVM before finally being turned into JavaScript. A side effect of this process is the generation of huge amounts of code, which bloats the exported application, overwhelms modern JavaScript engines and often causes the browser to run out of memory.\\n\\n### Load Time\\n\\nWe ran both apps on 12 different devices, from low end to high end. These were the recorded load times on a 50Mb/s connection to the net:\\n\\n| Device                          | Browser         | Unity (s) | PlayCanvas (s) |\\n| ------------------------------- | --------------- | --------- | -------------- |\\n| iPhone 4S                       | Safari          | Crash     | 2              |\\n| iPhone 5S                       | Safari          | 18        | 1              |\\n| iPhone 6                        | Safari          | 17        | 1              |\\n| iPad Mini 2                     | Safari          | 21        | 1              |\\n| Samsung Galaxy Tab S2           | Chrome 51       | 19        | 1              |\\n| Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014   | Chrome 51       | 28        | 1              |\\n| Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge          | Chrome 51       | 28        | 1              |\\n| Samsung Galaxy Note 4           | Chrome 51       | 28        | 1              |\\n| LG Nexus 4                      | Chrome 51       | 44        | 2              |\\n| Leapfrog Epic                   | Chrome 51       | 43        | 1              |\\n| Blackberry Z10                  | Default Browser | Crash     | 1              |\\n| PC (Core i7 + GeForce GTX 880M) | Chrome 51       | 13        | 1              |\\n\\nKey things to notice:\\n\\n- **The PlayCanvas app\'s load times are up to 43 times faster than the Unity app.**\\n- The Unity app fails to even load on lower end devices. The sheer amount of JavaScript causes the browser on those devices to run out of memory loading the page.\\n- Load times for Unity are up to twice as slow in Chrome as Safari. This could be down to Chrome spending more time preparing the app\'s\xa0huge\xa0JavaScript codebase for execution.\\n\\n### Frame Rate\\n\\nHere are the frame rates recorded for the same set of devices:\\n\\n| Device                          | Browser         | Unity (fps) | PlayCanvas (fps) |\\n| ------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |\\n| iPhone 4S                       | Safari          | Crash       | 58               |\\n| iPhone 5S                       | Safari          | 21          | 60               |\\n| iPhone 6                        | Safari          | 28          | 60               |\\n| iPad Mini 2                     | Safari          | 16          | 60               |\\n| Samsung Galaxy Tab S2           | Chrome 51       | 17-55       | 60               |\\n| Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014   | Chrome 51       | 15-50       | 60               |\\n| Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge          | Chrome 51       | 15-50       | 60               |\\n| Samsung Galaxy Note 4           | Chrome 51       | 15-57       | 60               |\\n| LG Nexus 4                      | Chrome 51       | 15-50       | 60               |\\n| Leapfrog Epic                   | Chrome 51       | 16-55       | 60               |\\n| Blackberry Z10                  | Default Browser | Crash       | 60               |\\n| PC (Core i7 + GeForce GTX 880M) | Chrome 51       | 57-60       | 60               |\\n\\nKey things to notice:\\n\\n- **PlayCanvas frame rates are up to 4 times greater than Unity.** In particular, Unity seems to perform poorly in Safari on iOS.\\n- Unity exhibits very unstable performance in Chrome for Android. Initially, the app\'s frame rate is in the mid to high teens for approximately 20 seconds before it starts to rise to a number in the 50s. At that point it, it regularly drops frames and never reaches a solid 60FPS.\\n- PlayCanvas easily locks to 60FPS across all devices except iPhone 4S where an occasional frame is dropped. Ideally, a much heavier stress test would be required to start taxing PlayCanvas.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nTo summarize:\\n\\n- **Unity WebGL apps are up to 21 times larger.**\\n- **PlayCanvas apps load up to 43 times faster.**\\n- **PlayCanvas app frame rates are up to 4 times higher.**\\n\\nEven for the most basic of 3D apps, Unity struggles to achieve anything close to acceptable download size, load time and frame rate. It\'s important not to somehow blame browser vendors or HTML5/WebGL for these results. As PlayCanvas proves, you can achieve incredible performance using these web technologies _today_ as long as a sensible approach is taken when architecting an engine.\\n\\nTo learn how PlayCanvas built an engine so optimized for the browser, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine) to explore the open sourced runtime.

After publishing this article, we noticed that the Unity project disables hardware anti-aliasing and uses bilinear filtering on the textures, whereas PlayCanvas enables AA and trilinear on the textures. So PlayCanvas is actually doing more work here."},{"id":"organizations-new-plans","metadata":{"permalink":"/organizations-new-plans","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2016-07-18-organizations-new-plans.md","source":"@site/blog/2016-07-18-organizations-new-plans.md","title":"Organizations & New Plans","description":"Today we\'re pleased to launch Organizations for PlayCanvas users along with an updated and simplified set of plans including unlimited projects and more storage.","date":"2016-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"plans","permalink":"/tags/plans"}],"readingTime":1.71,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","slug":"organizations-new-plans","title":"Organizations & New Plans","tags":["plans"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"PlayCanvas versus Unity WebGL","permalink":"/playcanvas-versus-unity-webgl"},"nextItem":{"title":"Realtime Chat Lands in the PlayCanvas Editor","permalink":"/realtime-chat-lands-in-the-playcanvas-editor"}},"content":"Today we\'re pleased to launch **Organizations** for PlayCanvas users along with an updated and simplified set of plans including unlimited projects and more storage.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Organizations\\n\\nAn organization offers you a convenient way to manage users and projects for businesses or for larger projects.

Except you\'ve got all your new code!\\n\\n### Real-time Collaborative Code Editing\\n\\nNow that scripts are\xa0first-class assets, we now support\xa0real-time collaboration in the Code Editor. This means you\'re no longer in danger overwriting other people\'s code. In fact, you can see it appear as they type.\\n\\nTo help support this, we\'ve also improved the error handling and fault tolerance of scripts\xa0while they\'re running. This means bad scripts\xa0won\'t bring your game screeching to a halt, preventing everyone from working.\\n\\n### Script Concatenation\\n\\nWith the new script format we now support multiple script definitions in a single JavaScript file. We\'ve added the option to concatenate and minify all your scripts into one file when you publish.\xa0This will save you\xa0many HTTP requests and reduces the size of your application, making for a much quicker start up time.\\n\\n### Try it Now\\n\\nScripts 2.0 is live right now and any new projects you create will have the new script system enabled. However, if you\'re not quite ready to move to the new system or you need some\xa0of the features that are currently only available with the old system, you can still create projects using the \\"Legacy Script System\\".

Let\'s celebrate with a PlayCanvas Dev Update! We\'ve been busy bees, so here\'s a rundown of the main changes.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Variance Shadow Maps\\n\\nThe light component now allows you to select a shadow type. In addition to the current PCF Shadow Maps, there are new options for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit Variance Shadow Maps. 8-bit VSM uses a small amount of GPU memory and is guaranteed to work on any device but is lower quality. 32-bit VSM uses a lot of GPU memory and\xa0relies on a device\'s ability to render to floating point textures but the quality is very good. 32-bit VSM will gracefully fall back to 16-bit and then to 8-bit should the device not provide the required capabilities.\\n\\nLet\'s compare PCF with VSM. First, here\'s PCF:\\n\\n[![shadows-sm](/img/shadows-sm.png)](/img/shadows-sm.png)\\n\\nAnd here is VSM:\\n\\n[![shadows-vsm](/img/shadows-vsm.png)](/img/shadows-vsm.png)\\n\\nThe big advantage of VSM is the ability to apply large blur kernels, which would be prohibitively slow with PCF. As you can see, the results are most pleasing!\\n\\nVSM is still work in progress so expect more updates to land in the engine in the coming weeks.\\n\\n### Reworked Editor Camera Controls\\n\\nWe\'ve completely rewritten the controls for the Editor camera in the 3D view. It should be far more intuitive now and also enable you to be more productive. For example, we have changed the behavior of dollying the camera to be based on what the mouse cursor is pointing at. This makes it feel much more similar to Google Maps:\\n\\n[![zoom](/img/zoom.gif)](/img/zoom.gif)\\n\\n### Easy Asset Inspection in Dev Tools\\n\\nWe\'ve made it so your assets are displayed\xa0in your browser\'s Dev Tools as they are in Editor\'s Asset Panel. This makes it much easier to locate, inspect and debug when running your game launched from the Editor.\\n\\n[![devtoolsassets](/img/devtoolsassets-1.png)](/img/devtoolsassets-1.png)\\n\\n### Engine Optimizations\\n\\nWe\'ve\xa0performed\xa0a thorough round of engine optimizations, aimed at speeding up your games, but also to reduce memory allocations to avoid garbage collection stalls. Specifically, we have:\\n\\n- Created a special profile build of the engine which is now only used when you run the PlayCanvas Profiler from the Editor. The regular non-profile build has the code that collects all of the timing and statistical information stripped out.\\n- Optimized many commonly used functions. [Here is a good example](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/commit/0212abf7a65ab8e26894275e630790ad6d04c904).\\n- Removed many allocations that used to happen at runtime. [Here is a good example](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/commit/3b8dc59b379d337e16b6237d48af30dfa43c3599).\\n\\n### Other Changes\\n\\n- Editor tooltips have been refactored with any missing ones added.\\n- Improved reporting of an asset\'s references when right clicking it in the Asset Panel."},{"id":"new-tutorials-multiplayer-with-nodejs-and-webgl-facebook-sdk","metadata":{"permalink":"/new-tutorials-multiplayer-with-nodejs-and-webgl-facebook-sdk","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2016-05-18-new-tutorials-multiplayer-with-nodejs-and-webgl-facebook-sdk.md","source":"@site/blog/2016-05-18-new-tutorials-multiplayer-with-nodejs-and-webgl-facebook-sdk.md","title":"New Tutorials: Multiplayer with Node.js and WebGL & Facebook SDK","description":"We\'ve added two new\xa0tutorials to our\xa0developer site this week.","date":"2016-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"facebook","permalink":"/tags/facebook"},{"inline":true,"label":"networking","permalink":"/tags/networking"},{"inline":true,"label":"tutorial","permalink":"/tags/tutorial"}],"readingTime":0.245,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","slug":"new-tutorials-multiplayer-with-nodejs-and-webgl-facebook-sdk","title":"New Tutorials: Multiplayer with Node.js and WebGL & Facebook SDK","tags":["facebook","networking","tutorial"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Variance Shadow Maps for WebGL and More!","permalink":"/variance-shadow-maps-for-webgl-and-more"},"nextItem":{"title":"Runtime Lightmap Generation for WebGL","permalink":"/runtime-lightmap-generation-for-webgl"}},"content":"We\'ve added two new\xa0tutorials to our\xa0developer site this week.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n**How to create a real time multiplayer game with Node.js\xa0and PlayCanvas** -\xa0[READ MORE](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/real-time-multiplayer/)\\n\\n![Real ti](/img/multiplayer.gif)\\n\\n**How to use the Facebook SDK in your WebGL application** -\xa0[READ MORE](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/facebook-api/)\\n\\n![Facebook_API](/img/facebook-api.jpg)\\n\\nYou can find\xa0loads more tutorials on our [developer site](https://developer.playcanvas.com)."},{"id":"runtime-lightmap-generation-for-webgl","metadata":{"permalink":"/runtime-lightmap-generation-for-webgl","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2016-04-14-runtime-lightmap-generation-for-webgl.md","source":"@site/blog/2016-04-14-runtime-lightmap-generation-for-webgl.md","title":"Runtime Lightmap Generation for WebGL","description":"For many years, lightmapping has been the mainstay of\xa0achieving low cost yet realistic\xa0lighting.

However, it\'s\xa0rarely seen in\xa0WebGL applications because generating lightmaps requires third-party modelling applications with complex workflows in order to bake\xa0out textures.\\n\\nAll that changes today as we introduce **Runtime Lightmap Generation** into the PlayCanvas Engine.\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://playcanv.as/p/txPePQvy/\\" title=\\"360 lookaround camera\\" webkitallowfullscreen=\\"true\\" mozallowfullscreen=\\"true\\" allow=\\"autoplay\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\" allowvr=\\"\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n_Here\'s a link to\xa0[full demo](https://playcanv.as/p/txPePQvy)._\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe demo above shows the engine\'s lightmap generation in action and this functionality is now available to all users via the PlayCanvas Editor.\\n\\n## How does it work?\\n\\nFor the uninitiated, lightmaps are extra textures that contain pre-computed lighting information that are applied to models at runtime. This means that instead of expensive per-pixel lighting, you can pre-compute static lighting that is incredibly cheap to render on the GPU.\\n\\nWe\'ve also specially designed our lightmapping solution for the needs of the web. In the Sponza scene above, there are 5 lights which generate 65 lightmaps applied to the 240,000 triangle mesh that makes up the scene. In total, this generates over 60MB of HDR\xa0lightmap textures. Even with an excellent compression ratio, it would be very time consuming to download this texture data. So we\'ve designed the PlayCanvas lightmapper to be unique among both native and WebGL engines. **The PlayCanvas Engine generates all lightmaps on application start.** In a few hundred milliseconds, we generate all the textures required for static lighting so your scene runs super-smoothly across all devices.\\n\\n## What\'s good about it?\\n\\n### Performance\\n\\nJust see for yourself. Switch between the lightmapped and dynamic lighting modes\xa0in the Sponza demo above. On a MacBook Pro or a recent mobile device like a Nexus 5 or iPhone 6, the lightmapped scene runs at 60fps. Using the real-time dynamic lighting we have to sample 5 filtered shadow maps (one for each light) which seriously affects performance.\\n\\nWith this new feature, we\'re enabling WebGL developers to create beautifully lit 3D scenes\xa0that run in all browsers from low end mobile\xa0to high end desktop. Not only will your application run smoothly on mobile, it will also load incredibly fast.\\n\\n### Ease-of-use\\n\\nThe lightmapping tools are built directly into the Editor. To\xa0get started, you just need to flick a couple of check boxes on your light and model components and hit the Bake button. Find out more by reading the new\xa0[documentation](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/graphics/lighting/runtime-lightmaps/).\\n\\n### Features, Features, Features\\n\\nOf course, there are also all the bells and whistles that make the lightmapper a dream to use. We generate HDR\xa0lightmaps so everything looks great. You can mix and match your static and dynamic lighting to\xa0give you the best of both worlds. We even auto-magically UV-unwrap your models if you haven\'t already generated\xa0lightmap UVs.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nThis is just the first step for the PlayCanvas\xa0Lightmapper. We\'ll soon be adding support for Specular Reflectance to the lightmapper.\xa0And beyond that:\xa0Global Illumination.\\n\\nBut don\'t wait, runtime lightmap generation is available to all users right now.

We\'ll be tweeting and blogging like crazy, keeping you in the loop."},{"id":"moving-playcanv-as-to-https","metadata":{"permalink":"/moving-playcanv-as-to-https","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2016-02-11-moving-playcanv-as-to-https.md","source":"@site/blog/2016-02-11-moving-playcanv-as-to-https.md","title":"Moving playcanv.as to HTTPS","description":"tanx","date":"2016-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"publishing","permalink":"/tags/publishing"}],"readingTime":1.615,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","slug":"moving-playcanv-as-to-https","title":"Moving playcanv.as to HTTPS","tags":["publishing"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"PlayCanvas brings WebGL Tools that Work to GDC 2016","permalink":"/playcanvas-brings-webgl-tools-that-work-to-gdc-2016"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Publishing Features","permalink":"/new-publishing-features"}},"content":"[![tanx](/img/tanx.jpg)](https://playcanv.as/p/aP0oxhUr)\\n_TANX running on HTTPS_\\n\\nFrom today we now support HTTPS URLs on all published applications. So anytime you see a link to something on [http://playcanv.as](http://playcanv.as) you can also use [https://playcanv.as](https://playcanv.as). After a short period of testing we\'ll be changing all default links to point to the HTTPS versions of\xa0the applications, though we will keep support for non-secure HTTP versions for the short term to ensure compatibility for applications that require a non-secure page.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThere are many reasons to use a secure HTTPS page, especially if you are doing\xa0transactions or taking money. But primarily for you as a PlayCanvas developer we\'re supporting HTTPS for two reasons.\\n\\n### Embedding\\n\\nWith an HTTPS page you can now embed the\xa0your\xa0PlayCanvas applications in any other page that requires a secure URL. Of note, this includes [Facebook Canvas](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/gamesonfacebook) games, so you can now publish your PlayCanvas game directly to Facebook.\\n\\n### Secure Powerful Features\\n\\nMajor browsers such as Chrome and Firefox are currently in the process of [securing all](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=481604) \\"powerful features\\". Which means only allowing access to these features on secure pages. These features include:\\n\\n- Device Motion\\n- Device Orientation\\n- Encrypted Media Extensions\\n- Fullscreen API (including pointer lock)\\n- Geolocation\\n- getUserMedia (webcam access)\\n\\nSoon it won\'t be possible to access these\xa0JavaScript APIs without using a secure HTTPS page. In advance of this time, we want to make sure your hosted PlayCanvas\xa0applications can support all these features.\\n\\n### What this means for you\\n\\nAs a developer our transition to HTTPS should be seamless and you shouldn\'t notice.\xa0Though one area to watch out for is that an HTTPS page is not able to load resources from a non-secure page. So if you are loading fonts or images from other servers that are insecure they may be blocked (depending on exactly how you load them) when running your\xa0PlayCanvas application from HTTPS. The solution is to make sure all external resources are loaded via HTTPS."},{"id":"new-publishing-features","metadata":{"permalink":"/new-publishing-features","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2016-02-09-new-publishing-features.md","source":"@site/blog/2016-02-09-new-publishing-features.md","title":"New Publishing Features","description":"Today we\'ve launched an update to\xa0streamline the way you publish your applications and to give your collaborators more information about what is changing.","date":"2016-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"publishing","permalink":"/tags/publishing"}],"readingTime":0.705,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","slug":"new-publishing-features","title":"New Publishing Features","tags":["publishing"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Moving playcanv.as to HTTPS","permalink":"/moving-playcanv-as-to-https"},"nextItem":{"title":"PLAYHACK with PlayJam starts today","permalink":"/playhack-with-playjam-starts-today"}},"content":"Today we\'ve launched an update to\xa0streamline the way you publish your applications and to give your collaborators more information about what is changing.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nFirst big change, the publishing process is now right there next to you in the Editor. \xa0Look for the new\xa0publish button in your toolbar.\\n\\n![Editor 3](/img/Editor-3.jpg)\\n\\nSecond\xa0big change, we\'ve added some additional properties when you\xa0publish a new build.

Robots! UFOs!** There is a secondary\xa0theme which\xa0ties into making your game available on PlayJam\u2019s upcoming mobile game network:\\n\\n### Challenge your mates\\n\\nWe want games that you and your friends can compete in. That could be something simple like a high score table or getting the fastest lap time or something as complicated as network multiplayer (not for the faint-hearted). What we\u2019re looking for is for people to shout _\u201cBeat that!\u201d_ after playing.\\n\\n### Mobile first\\n\\nWe want games that work well in mobile browsers. That means touch support, landscape or portrait design and great simple mechanics. Ideally, they\u2019ll work on desktop too, but mobile phones are the target.\\n\\n## Prizes\\n\\nDid we mention that there are incredible prizes to win! Seriously awesome ones.\\n\\n- **1st Prize - \xa32000** (~$2800)\\n- **2nd Prize - \xa31000** (~$1400)\\n- **3rd Prize - \xa3500** (~$700)\\n\\nJudging will start on the 12th March and we\u2019ll only play builds that are published before that day.\\n\\n## How To Enter\\n\\n- Fork the [PLAYHACK project](https://playcanvas.com/project/374578/overview/playhack-feb-16) into your account\\n- Build your game using your newly forked project.\\n- Use the 3D assets we supply and pay attention to the theme.\\n- Post to your devlog about your game throughout the competition.\\n- The competition ends on the 11th of March.

The Sound Component takes on all the capabilities of the Audio Source Component (which is now deprecated) and layers on more features than\xa0violins in an orchestra.\\n\\nHere are the old things we\'re still doing:\\n\\n- Web Audio API support with fallback to Audio Element\\n- 3D positional sound\\n- volume and pitch controls\\n\\nAnd lets\xa0just list out all the cool new things:\\n\\n- Multiple sound slots\xa0per component\\n- Individual settings for volume, pitch, autoplay, loop and overlap\\n- Play the same sound overlapping (great for spot effects)\\n- Fire-and-forget sounds (keeps playing after Entity is deleted)\\n- Audio Events fired for looping, loading,\xa0stopping, pausing, etc\\n- Access to full\xa0Web Audio API nodes (add your own effects)\\n- Sound atlas support (play from any point to another point)\\n- Start playing from any\xa0point in audio\\n- Set current time, seek with in\xa0sound\\n- Lovely new JavaScript\xa0API\\n\\nThese features open up a whole bunch of doors with what you can do with audio in your games and applications. For example, overlapping sounds\xa0means you only need a single sound component to do rapid fire gun shots. Fire-and-forget sounds mean you can\xa0play and explosion sound and delete the entity without worrying about\xa0the sound stopping. Access the Web Audio nodes means you can add effects like reverb and more to your sound. Seeking within sounds makes music games possible. And in general your\xa0audio code will now be\xa0cleaner, simpler and shorter.\\n\\n## Documentation & Tutorials\\n\\n[![analyzer-thin](/img/analyser-thin1.jpg)](/img/analyser-thin1.jpg)\\n\\nTo help you get up to speed with all the new features, we\'ve update the\xa0[documentation](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/packs/components/sound/) and the [reference api](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/SoundComponent.html).\\n\\nBut we\'ve also created a few\xa0tutorials to show you how it all works.\\n\\n### Basic Audio\\n\\nThis [tutorial](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/basic-audio/) covers how to setup a component and\xa0managing the audio settings on different slots.

The Editor will remember the option you select for the next time you hit the Launch icon.\\n\\nThere is also a **hot-key** to toggle the Profiler: CTRL (CMD) + ALT + T.\\n\\n### Profiler Overview\\n\\n[![profiler_stats](/img/profiler_stats.png)](/img/profiler_stats.png)\\n\\nThe left-hand panel of the Profiler displays statistics related to the currently rendered scene. It displays frame rate, the number of cameras enabled (normally, you will want this to be 1), the number of shaders, materials, triangles and so on. Also, frame time is broken down into update (the time to run all component updates), physics (simulation time) and render time (the time to\xa0pass all of the graphics commands to WebGL). At a glance, you can quickly see where there might be problems.\\n\\n[![profiler_timeline](/img/profiler_timeline.png)](/img/profiler_timeline.png)\\n\\nThe right-hand panel is the Profiler Timeline. It displays a number of key events in your app\'s life from launch:\\n\\n- **dom**\xa0(DOM interactive):\xa0 event when the browser finishes parsing html document, and able to render first frame of a page to a screen\\n- **preload**: event when PlayCanvas initiates preloading of all assets that are required before the app can start.\\n- **start**: event when PlayCanvas begins the main application loop and rendering begins.\\n\\nGreen bars represent individual asynchronous asset loads. Orange bars are blocking shader compilations.\\n\\n### The Future\'s Bright\\n\\nSo we hope you enjoy using the new Profiler. But remember, true believers, more goodness is yet to come. This is our initial beta version but\xa0we have plenty of improvements coming down the pipe.\\n\\nAny comments?

So without further ado...\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Editor Tags and Engine Tag API\\n\\nThe feedback we\'ve been getting is that your projects are continuing to grow. More assets, more entities, more complexity. It makes it hard to find and organize things, right? To help you out, we\'ve introduced Tags to the Editor interface. We\'re starting out with Assets. Check out how you tag your assets:\\n\\n[![tags](/img/tags.gif)](/img/tags.gif)\\n\\nTo search for Assets, we have introduced a new [pc.Tags API](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Tags.html). Let\'s quickly look at some examples:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Return all assets tagged by \'level-1\'\\nvar assets = app.assets.findByTag(\\"level-1\\");\\n\\n// Return all assets tagged by \'level-1\' OR \'level-2\'\\nvar assets = app.assets.findByTag(\\"level-1\\", \\"level-2\\");\\n\\n// Return all assets tagged by \'level-1\' AND \'monster\'\\nvar assets = app.assets.findByTag([\\"level-1\\", \\"monster\\"]);\\n\\n// Return all assets tagged by (\'level-1\' AND \'monster\') OR (\'level-2\' AND \'monster\')\\nvar assets = app.assets.findByTag([\\"level-1\\", \\"monster\\"], [\\"level-2\\", \\"monster\\"]);\\n```\\n\\nNext up is to support tagging of entities. Look out for this feature landing sometime soon.\\n\\n### Curve and Entity Script Attributes\\n\\nWe have added a couple of new script attribute types for you to expose to the Editor UI: curves and entities.\\n\\nCurve attributes can be used to define how a value or values change over time. Consider it a simple keyframing tool. To define a curve script attribute, use the following notation:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Specify a single curve\\npc.script.attribute(\'singleCurve\', \'curve\');\\n\\n// Specify a set of 3 curves labelled x, y, z\\npc.script.attribute(\'xyzCurve\', \'curve\', null, {\\n    curves: [\'x\', \'y\', \'z\']\\n});\\n\\n// Specify a set of 3 curves labelled r, g, b with a color preview\\npc.script.attribute(\'rgbCurve\', \'colorcurve\');\\n\\n// Specify a set of 4 curves labelled r, g, b, a with a color preview\\npc.script.attribute(\'rgbaCurve\', \'colorcurve\', null, {\\n    curves: [\'r\', \'g\', \'b\', \'a\'],\\n    type: \'rgba\'\\n});\\n```\\n\\nCheck out the colorcurve control\'s functionality below:\\n\\n[![colorcurve](/img/colorcurve.gif)](/img/colorcurve.gif)\\n\\nTo define an entity script attribute, use the following notation:\\n\\n```javascript\\npc.script.attribute(\'target\', \'entity\');\\n```\\n\\nThis exposes an entity picker to your script UI. Even cooler is that you can drag entities from the Hierarchy panel directly onto the picker, as shown below:\\n[![entitydrag](/img/entitydrag.gif)](/img/entitydrag.gif)\\n\\nThat\'s it for this update, friends. Now get back to making cool stuff! :D"},{"id":"development-update-major-improvements-ahoy","metadata":{"permalink":"/development-update-major-improvements-ahoy","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2015-08-14-development-update-major-improvements-ahoy.md","source":"@site/blog/2015-08-14-development-update-major-improvements-ahoy.md","title":"Development Update: Major Improvements Ahoy!","description":"Have you noticed that everybody seems to go on vacation in August?

You can also hover on the semi-transparent rectangle of the camera to see a username tooltip to find out who\'s keeping you company.\\n  [![usercamera](/img/usercamera.gif)](/img/usercamera.gif)\\n- Most assets are now triggering previews when dragged: drag a material to a material asset slot without dropping it and it will swap temporarily in the 3D view for preview. This applies to: textures, materials and cubemaps.\\n- Materials are now draggable into the 3D view. Just drag them right onto the model.\\n  [![switchmaterial](/img/switchmaterial.gif)](/img/switchmaterial.gif)\\n- Cubemaps are now draggable into the 3D view. Drag onto materials to apply as an environment map, or onto the background in the 3D view to apply as a scene skybox.\\n- Tooltips are now shown when hovering on entities in the 3D view\xa0(after a short delay).\\n- Read-only collaborators\xa0are now able to click on the \\"View\\" button of code-based assets to open a read-only view of the script in the Script Editor.\\n\\n#### Asset System Improvements\\n\\n- Asset loading has been heavily refactored.\\n- Assets now manage their own reloads way more efficiently.\\n- The Model Component processes any asset updates far faster.\\n- Reduced number of re-uploads to GPU of texture assets.\\n- A cube map now uploads to the GPU only if it has valid data and only if one or more faces have changed.\\n\\n#### Graphics Engine Improvements\\n\\n- Shaders are no longer linked\xa0on creation, but only when used to avoid blocking on completion of shader compilation. This generally improves load time.\\n- Texture state setting is now far more optimal leading to major rendering speedups.\\n\\n#### Fixes\\n\\n- Asset thumbnails should now refresh in the assets panel on a re-upload.\\n- Gizmos are now not draggable outside of viewport.\\n- For the opacity map of a material, the \\"RGB\\" option has been removed, because it\xa0led to shadows disappearing.\\n\\nThat\'s it for this week. We hope you like the improvements. Anything we\'re not working on that you want to see added to PlayCanvas? Tell us on the forum!\\n\\nHave a great weekend!"},{"id":"playcanvas-pioneers-3d-rich-media-ad-format-for-facebook-and-twitter","metadata":{"permalink":"/playcanvas-pioneers-3d-rich-media-ad-format-for-facebook-and-twitter","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2015-08-12-playcanvas-pioneers-3d-rich-media-ad-format-for-facebook-and-twitter.md","source":"@site/blog/2015-08-12-playcanvas-pioneers-3d-rich-media-ad-format-for-facebook-and-twitter.md","title":"PlayCanvas pioneers 3D rich media ad format for Facebook and Twitter","description":"PlayCanvas, the leading tool for creating interactive 3D content for the web, today announced that it is powering the launch of the first interactive 3D social media campaign for Hutch Games\u2019s smash hit mobile game MMX Racing featuring WWE.","date":"2015-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ads","permalink":"/tags/ads"}],"readingTime":1.365,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","slug":"playcanvas-pioneers-3d-rich-media-ad-format-for-facebook-and-twitter","title":"PlayCanvas pioneers 3D rich media ad format for Facebook and Twitter","tags":["ads"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Development Update: Major Improvements Ahoy!","permalink":"/development-update-major-improvements-ahoy"},"nextItem":{"title":"What\'s new?

PlayCanvas is the only engine technology that can bring these experiences to life on the web or in social networking apps.\\n\\nPlayCanvas co-founder and CEO Will Eastcott said today:\\n\\n> User acquisition is the biggest problem facing mobile game developers today. By using their existing assets in exciting, shareable and viral ways game developers can attract engaged players who have already demonstrated an interest in their game.\\n>\\n> This is changing the way developers think about promoting their games. PlayCanvas has unlocked the ability to make beautiful and exciting visuals available directly to players, in their browser and in their social network feeds. We know that interactive content can convert users as much as 50% more than static images and we expect PlayCanvas-powered interactive campaigns to become the standard way to promote mobile games."},{"id":"whats-new-html-assets-new-gizmos-viewport-improvements","metadata":{"permalink":"/whats-new-html-assets-new-gizmos-viewport-improvements","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2015-07-31-whats-new-html-assets-new-gizmos-viewport-improvements.md","source":"@site/blog/2015-07-31-whats-new-html-assets-new-gizmos-viewport-improvements.md","title":"What\'s new?

We\'ve launched a bunch of new features\xa0today and over the last few weeks. So here\'s a quick summary!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## 3D view\xa0updates\\n\\n[![Collision Mesh](/img/doom-collision.jpg)](/img/doom-collision.jpg)\\n\\nToday we released a whole bunch of changes to the editor, with a focus on making the viewport\xa0simpler, better, and easier to use. We\'ve de-cluttered by turning off camera, light and collision gizmos unless you have the entity selected. We\'ve\xa0also added a proper view for the collision mesh type so you can see just how many triangles your colliding against :-)\\n\\nAlso, we\'ve added convenient icons for all the\xa0entity types, so you can see and select everything from inside the viewport.\\n\\n[![icons](/img/icons.jpg)](/img/icons.jpg)\\n\\n## HTML and CSS assets\\n\\nYou can\xa0now upload .html and .css files\xa0as assets. This\xa0is\xa0incredibly useful when you want to build UIs as part of your applications. No more HTML and CSS in strings.\\n\\n## Collaborative editing\\n\\nWe\'ve also got full collaborative editing for text based assets, that is:\xa0HTML, CSS, text and JSON files. This means you can comfortably edit with a friend where ever they are in the world.\\n\\n## Project Export / Import\\n\\nA heavily requested feature for our enterprise users is the ability to take a complete back up of everything you\'ve got in PlayCanvas. So for ORG level account holders, we\'ve added the Project Export feature. From the new projects interface, use the drop down to select Export Project and you\'ll get a link to a zip file containing everything\xa0in your projects. Assets, Scenes, Scripts, etc.\\n\\n[![Project Export](/img/project-export.png)](/img/project-export.png)\\n\\nImporting is just as simple, on the same page you\'ll see an import project button. Use this to upload the zip file you received from exporting and we\'ll create a new project with all the data from the archive.\\n\\n## Custom Loading Screens\\n\\nAnother feature for the ORG user\'s. Sometimes you\'ve got a client who just doesn\'t want to see that PlayCanvas logo\xa0upfront when loading your application (crazy people!). So now you\xa0have access to a custom loading script which lets you do as you please during the preload phase of\xa0application loading. You\'ll find the\xa0**Loading Screen** option at the bottom of the Settings panel in the Editor.\\n\\n## The full list\\n\\nThere have been loads more little bonus features to help you build games and applications using PlayCanvas. Here\'s a big list.\\n\\n- Upload HTML and CSS assets types\\n- Project exporting / importing [ORG Plans]\\n- Custom loading screens [ORG Plans]\\n- New projects tab\\n- Online Collaborative Editing for HTML, CSS, text and JSON assets\\n- De-clutter viewport by hiding gizmo\'s for unselected entities\\n- Added gizmo for collision component of `asset` type, now it renders asset on top with overlay\\n- Improved gizmos for spot lights.\\n- Added icons to entities without model\\n- Added icons size setting to designer settings (bottom left corner)\\n- Fixed focusing, now it takes in account children entities\\n- Right mouse button now does only look around, and ignores any picking and gizmo interactions\\n- Renaming entity by double clicking in a tree.\\n- Icon `*` visible on top right corner of each asset in an asset panel, when asset is considered as \\"possibly unused\\".\\n- Added `skyboxIntensity` and `skyboxMip` selectors to Scene Settings.\\n- Added UV Selector for textures in material inspector\\n- Added Use Vertex Color for each slot to material inspector, it will use vertex color instead of texture for that particular slot"},{"id":"humble-game-making-bundle","metadata":{"permalink":"/humble-game-making-bundle","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2015-07-14-humble-game-making-bundle.md","source":"@site/blog/2015-07-14-humble-game-making-bundle.md","title":"Humble Game Making Bundle","description":"PlayCanvas is delighted to be part of the Humble Game Making Bundle.","date":"2015-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.35,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","slug":"humble-game-making-bundle","title":"Humble Game Making Bundle"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"What\'s new?

First, we delivered asset multi-selection. And today, we\'re happy to announce we deployed entity multi-selection. So now, you can CTRL+click multiple entities either in the Hierarchy panel or in the 3D view. This selection can then be manipulated, either via the gizmos or in the Inspector. Don\'t believe me? Feast your eyes on this:\\n\\n[![multiselection](/img/multiselection.gif)](/img/multiselection.gif)\\n\\n(Ed: Can somebody get Will to stop using Doom3 characters in his screenshots??)\\n\\n### New Gizmos\\n\\nOn the subject of gizmos, you may notice they look marginally different. In fact, they\'ve been completely rewritten from scratch. You use the gizmos constantly when building scenes in PlayCanvas, so they need to be absolutely rock solid and a joy to use. We think we\'ve nailed it. Give them a try and let us know what you think.\\n\\n### Faster Lighting\\n\\nBy now, you\'ll be familiar with PlayCanvas\' physically based renderer. Objects in a scene are lit based on cube maps that define environmental lighting on a per-pixel basis (this is Image Based Lighting). We\'ve spent a few weeks speeding this up to make it absolutely sing on lower-end mobile devices. If you want to track our work on the engine, you need to be hitting the Watch button on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine).\\n\\n### More Feedback Please\\n\\nWe hope you\'re all enjoying the new Editor. The response has been phenomenal so far. But keep that feedback coming. Head over to [the forum to join the conversation](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/playcanvas-editor-feedback/616).

When we talk about\xa0a \\"resource\\" we are\xa0referring to some data, usually stored in a file, that can be loaded by\xa0a PlayCanvas application. When the resource data is loaded, the engine creates a instance of some class that came from that data. e.g. the resource \\"image.png\\", is loaded to a creates an instance of a `pc.Texture`. The same applies for a 3D model, an animation or sound effect.\\n\\nWhen we talk about as \\"asset\\" we are referring to a\xa0reference to a resource, with some associated data. For example a texture asset looks something like this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\"id\\": 14761,\\n    \\"name\\": \\"Cerberus_G\\",\\n    \\"type\\": \\"texture\\",\\n    \\"preload\\": true,\\n    \\"file\\": {\\n        \\"url\\": \\"files/assets/14761/1/Cerberus_G.jpg\\",\\n        \\"size\\": 816084,\\n        \\"hash\\": \\"dc49dac4f4775191b7643b4583b3ac3f\\",\\n        \\"filename\\": \\"Cerberus_G.jpg\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"data\\": {\\n        \\"minfilter\\": \\"linear_mip_linear\\",\\n        \\"name\\": \\"Cerberus_G\\",\\n        \\"magfilter\\": \\"linear\\",\\n        \\"addressu\\": \\"repeat\\",\\n        \\"addressv\\": \\"repeat\\",\\n        \\"anisotropy\\": 1\\n    },\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can see the asset data for this texture as an ID, a name, a reference to the file where the resource data is, plus some additional data which isn\'t stored in the image file. This data is used to create the texture resource. Some assets contain lots of data (materials) some none (a text file).\\n\\nOnce loaded into the engine, you can use the asset registry to find assets, and you can access the loaded resource (if it is loaded) from the asset using the `asset.resources` property.\\n\\nOn to the changes:\\n\\n## Editor Changes\\n\\n### Asset Preloading\\n\\n[![preload](/img/preload.jpg)](/img/preload.jpg)\\n\\nThe first new feature is\xa0**asset preload**. Previously we would\xa0load any assets that were referenced by your scene. We changed this\xa0behavior so that now assets have a specific\xa0**preload** property which you can enable or disable. Any asset marked as preload, _and we default this to true for new assets_, will be loaded during the loading screen stage and will be ready to use when your application starts. Any that are not marked as preload, will remain on the server, ready to be loaded when you need them.\\n\\nWe\'ve updated\xa0existing assets to mark all existing target\xa0assets are preload. So you may need to uncheck this option on some assets if you don\'t actually need them.\\n\\n### Export and Publishing\\n\\nWhen you publish an app\xa0or\xa0choose to download an export of your app, we now include\xa0_all_ assets in the package.\xa0As you can\xa0choose whether or not to preload assets, this means that\xa0you can select only a subset of your assets to be loaded before your application starts. Then you can load other assets at any other stage later on. This lets you use many more assets in your games and applications but not worry about\xa0start up time. Just stream your assets in later on.\\n\\n### Script Loading Order\\n\\nScript loading has had an overhaul, we now load scripts in parallel with other assets so load times should be reduced.\xa0We have also changed which scripts are loaded. Previously, we\'d only load scripts\xa0which are referenced in scenes. **We now load all scripts in your repository.** Because of this we\'ve introduced a way to set the order in which your scripts are loaded.\\n\\n[![script-priority](/img/script-priority.jpg)](/img/script-priority.jpg)\\n\\nFound in the menu, you can use the script loading priority dialog to choose scripts you wish to load first.\\n\\n## API changes\\n\\n### Asset\xa0Registry\\n\\nThe\xa0`AssetRegistry` object has changed slightly\xa0in the new API. The core methods are shown below. As\xa0before the `AssetRegistry` object is available in your scripts as `app.assets`.\\n\\n```javascript\\napp.assets.get(id) - get by id\\napp.assets.find(name, type) - search by name, return first result\\napp.assets.findAll(name, type) - search by name, return all\\napp.assets.load(asset) - load remote resource for asset\\n```\\n\\nThe main change here is that `load()` no longer accepts a list of assets and it no longer returns a promise. We\'re removing promise from the\xa0engine in favour of node.js style callbacks and events.\\n\\n_Note, we have left in a\xa0compatibility version of assets.load which accepts a list of assets and returns a promise. You should\xa0update your code to remove this as it will not be in the engine forever._\\n\\n### Asset Events\\n\\nThe asset registry (and the asset\xa0object) fire a consistent set of events which you can\xa0use to react to changes on the registry. These can be used to monitor loading progress or respond\xa0if you wish to dynamically add assets to the registry.\\n\\n```javascript\\nassets.on(\\"add\\", callback) - triggered when asset added to registry\\nassets.on(\\"add:{id}\\", callback) - triggered when asset added to registry\\nassets.on(\\"add:url:{url}\\", callback) - triggered when asset added to registry\\nassets.on(\\"remove\\", callback) - triggered when asset added to registry\\nassets.on(\\"remove:{id}\\", callback) - triggered when asset added to registry\\nassets.on(\\"remove:url:{url}\\", callback) - triggered when asset added to registry\\nassets.on(\\"load\\", callback) - triggered on successful load\\nassets.on(\\"load:{id}\\", callback) - triggered on successful load\\nassets.on(\\"error\\", callback) - triggered on asset loading error\\nassets.on(\\"error:{id}\\", callback) - triggered on asset loading error\\nasset.on(\\"change\\", callback) - triggered when asset data changes\\n```\\n\\nA good pattern for\xa0loading and using an asset is like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nasset.ready(function (asset) {\\n    // use asset.resource here\\n});\\nassets.load(asset);\\n```\\n\\n`asset.ready()` will call the callback when if when the asset is loaded. If it\'s already loaded from before, the callback is called immediately. `asset.load()` does nothing if the asset is already loaded.\\n\\n### Resource Loader\\n\\nThe resource loader is a lower level interface than the asset registry.\xa0Most users won\'t need to access this directly as they will use the asset registry to load data. But this API has changed significantly. We\'ve made it much simpler:\\n\\n```javascript\\napp.loader.load(url, type, callback);\\n```\\n\\nI\'ll just leave it there, see the API docs if you need more information.\\n\\n#### Application Scene Loading\\n\\nWe\'ve added a simple API for loading new scene data via the `app` object\\n\\n```javascript\\napp.loadSceneHierarchy(url, callback)\xa0// load a scene file, get hierarchy, append hierarchy to app.root\\napp.loadSceneSettings(url, callback)  // load a scene file, apply settings (lighting/physics) to current scene\\n```\\n\\nThese two functions accept the URL of the scene file which will be in the format \\"scene_id.json\\" e.g. \\"100.json\\".\\n\\n### Upgrade guide\\n\\nHopefully you\'ll find your application continues work as before, only now it loads faster and you have more options available to you for\xa0dynamically loading assets. However, this is a breaking API change so you may need to update your projects.\\n\\n**`app.assets.load(asset)`**\\n\\nIf you are using this and passing in a single asset, we no longer return a promise. You should replace your code with this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nasset.ready(function (asset) {\\n  // use asset\\n});\\napp.assets.load(asset);\\n```\\n\\n**`app.assets.load(assets)`**\\n\\nIf you are\xa0loading a list of assets, our compatible load should still work. However, you should update your code to use the new loading format. As below\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar toload = []; // list of assets\\nvar count = 0;\\ntoload.forEach(function (asset) {\\n    asset.ready(function (asset) {\\n        count++;\\n        if (count === toload.length) {\\n            // done\\n        }\\n    });\\n    app.assets.load(asset);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n**`app.loader.request()`**\\n\\nIf you were using this to\xa0make resource requests like loading Packs or asking for\xa0texture data. This is all new. You should be able to replace these calls with some other method.\xa0Maybe\xa0`app.loadSceneHierarchy()` or by using\xa0asset preloading to delay loading texture data. However if you really need to load a resource directly. You can use the resource loader API:\\n\\n```javascript\\napp.loader.load(url, function (err, resource) {\\n    if (!err) {\\n        // use resource\\n    }\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThat\'s it!\xa0If you notice any problems or have trouble upgrading, get in touch on the [forum](https://forum.playcanvas.com/)."},{"id":"playcanvas-in-the-spotlight-at-3d-web-fest","metadata":{"permalink":"/playcanvas-in-the-spotlight-at-3d-web-fest","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2015-05-15-playcanvas-in-the-spotlight-at-3d-web-fest.md","source":"@site/blog/2015-05-15-playcanvas-in-the-spotlight-at-3d-web-fest.md","title":"PlayCanvas in the Spotlight at 3D Web Fest","description":"On May 13th, San Francisco played host to 3D Web Fest.","date":"2015-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"event","permalink":"/tags/event"}],"readingTime":1.645,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Will Eastcott","title":"CEO","description":"Will Eastcott is an entrepreneur and veteran technologist of the games industry with experience at EA, Sony, and Activision.

Here\'s a quick run down of the coolness we\'ve deployed for you!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## HDR Cubemaps\\n\\nWe\'ve taken lighting to a whole new level of realism in PlayCanvas. The Editor now supports the import of HDR images to build HDR cubemaps.\\n\\n[![hdr](/img/hdr.jpg)](/img/hdr.jpg)\\n\\n[CLICK HERE TO RUN DEMO](https://playcanv.as/p/3zUijwTX)\\n\\nHDR image formats supported are .hdr and .exr.\xa0When a texture is selected in the Inspector, there is now a property called HDR which is either true or false. So the workflow to construct an HDR cubemap for image based lighting is now:\\n\\n1. Upload 6 HDR images\\n\\n2. Create a new cubemap asset and select it so that it is shown in Inspector\\n\\n3. Assign the six images as cubemap faces\\n\\n4. Hit the Prefilter button in Inspector\\n\\n5. Open the Scene Settings (the cog in the bottom left\xa0of the Editor UI)\\n\\n6. Assign the HDR cubemap asset to the Skybox property in Scene Settings\\n\\nNow, physical materials will use the HDR cubemap as the source for image based lighting.\\n\\n## Multi-selection: Phase 1\\n\\nWe\'ve deployed the first phase of a really useful new feature: multi-selection. Initially, this works for texture and cubemap assets. In the Assets panel, you can now SHIFT or CTRL click multiple textures or cubemaps. This allows you to do several things:\\n\\n- Delete multiple assets simultaneously\\n- Change shared properties once for all assets in the selection\\n- Display the summed size all assets in the selection\\n\\nStay tuned for multi-selection support for other asset types and entities too!\\n\\n## Material Duplication\\n\\nIf you right click a material asset, you can now duplicate it via the context menu:\\n\\n[![Duplicate Material](/img/editor-material-duplicate.png)](/img/editor-material-duplicate.png)\\n\\n## Audio Preview\\n\\nNow you can play back your audio assets directly from the Editor. Select the audio asset in the Assets panel and the Inspector now shows a play button:\\n\\n[![Audio Asset](/img/editor-audio-asset.png)](/img/editor-audio-asset.png)\\n\\nThat\'s all for this week, folks.

If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, it takes WebGL graphics to a whole new level.\\n\\n[![seemore](/img/seemore.jpg)](/img/seemore.jpg)\\n[**CLICK HERE**](http://seemore.playcanvas.com) TO LAUNCH SEEMORE\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nSo why did we build this demo? We had two key goals:\\n\\n1. **Put amazing demo content in the hands of you, the developer.** Seemore WebGL is the first conference demo that has been developed to run specifically in the web browser. This is great, because you can run it for yourself and do so on any device. Nothing to download and install - hit a link, and you\u2019re immediately dropped into a stunning 3D experience. And better yet, you can learn from the demo and use that knowledge in your own creations.\\n2. **Demonstrate console quality graphics on mobile.** ARM Mali GPUs pack a serious graphical punch and Seemore is designed to fully demonstrate this power. We have taken\xa0advanced graphical features seen in the latest generation of console titles and optimized them to be completely mobile friendly. And best of all, all of this technology is [open sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine).\\n\\nIt\'s not practical to examine all of the engine updates we made to bring Seemore to life. So instead, let\u2019s examine three of the more interesting engine features that were developed for the project.\\n\\n### Prefiltered Cubemaps\\n\\nThis is the generation and usage of prefiltered cubemaps. Each mipmap level stores environment reflection at different level of surface roughness - from mirror-like to diffuse.\\n\\n[![prefilter](/img/prefilter.jpg)](/img/prefilter.jpg)\\n\\n#### How We Did It {#how-we-did-it-1}\\n\\nFirst, we added a cubemap filtering utility to the engine (GPU-based importance sampling). The next step was to expose this functionality in the PlayCanvas Editor. This technique uses Phong lobes of different sizes to pre-blur each mip level. Runtime shaders use either the EXT_shader_texture_lod extension (where supported) or reference mip levels stored as individual textures that are interpolated manually.\\n\\n#### Source Code {#source-code-1}\\n\\n[https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/202](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/202)\\n\\n#### Further Reading {#further-reading-1}\\n\\n- [https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-iii-rendering/chapter-20-gpu-based-importance-sampling](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-iii-rendering/chapter-20-gpu-based-importance-sampling)\\n- [https://seblagarde.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/amd-cubemapgen-for-physically-based-rendering/](https://seblagarde.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/amd-cubemapgen-for-physically-based-rendering/)\\n\\n### Box-projected Cubemaps\\n\\nThis feature makes cubemaps work as if projected onto the insides of a box, instead of being infinitely far away (as with a regular skybox cubemap). This technique is widely used in games for interior reflection and refraction.\\n\\n[![bpcem34](/img/bpcem34.jpg)](/img/bpcem34.jpg)\\n\\n#### How We Did It {#how-we-did-it-2}\\n\\nThis effect is implemented using a world-space AABB projection. Refraction uses the same code as reflection but with a different ray direction, so the projection automatically applies to it as well.\\n\\n#### Source Code {#source-code-2}\\n\\n[https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/183](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/183)\\n\\n#### Further Reading {#further-reading-2}\\n\\n- [https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/568829-box-projected-cubemap-environment-mapping/](https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/568829-box-projected-cubemap-environment-mapping/)\\n\\n### Custom Shader Chunks\\n\\nStandard material shaders in PlayCanvas are assembled from multiple code \'chunks\'. Often, you don\'t want to replace the whole shader, but you\'d like to only change some parts of it, like adding some procedural ambient occlusion or changing the way a surface reflects light.\\n\\nThis feature was required in Seemore to achieve the following:\\n\\n- **Dual baked ambient occlusion.** The main plant uses 2 AO maps for open and closed mouth states which are interpolated dynamically.\\n  [![AO](/img/seemore-ao.jpg)](/img/seemore-ao.jpg)\\n- **Fake foliage translucency.** This attenuates emission to make it appear as though light is scattered on the back-faces of leaves in a hemispherically lit room. The plant\u2019s head uses a more complex version of the effect, calculating per-vertex procedural light occlusion.\\n  [![fol](/img/seemore-foliage.jpg)](/img/seemore-foliage.jpg)\\n- **Plant/tentacle animation.** Procedural code that drives vertex positions/normals/tangents.\\n\\n#### How We Did It {#how-we-did-it-3}\\n\\nShader chunks are stored in the engine sourcebase as .vert and .frag files that contain snippets of GLSL. You can find all of these files [here](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/tree/main/src/scene/shader-lib/chunks). Here\u2019s an example chunk that applies exponential squared fog to a fragment:\\n\\n```glsl\\nuniform vec3 fog_color;\\nuniform float fog_density;\\n\\nvec3 addFog(inout psInternalData data, vec3 color) {\\n    float depth = gl_FragCoord.z / gl_FragCoord.w;\\n    float fogFactor = exp(-depth * depth * fog_density * fog_density);\\n    fogFactor = clamp(fogFactor, 0.0, 1.0);\\n    return mix(fog_color, color, fogFactor);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nEach chunk file\u2019s name becomes its name at runtime, with PS or VS appended, depending on whether the chunk forms part of a vertex or pixel shader. In the case above, the filename is fogExp2.frag. It\u2019s a simple matter to replace this fragment on a material. Simply do:\\n\\n```javascript\\nmaterial.chunks.fogExp2PS = myCustomShaderString;\\n```\\n\\n#### Source Code {#source-code-3}\\n\\n[https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/172](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/pull/172)\\n\\nSo there you have it.

I\'ve been a software developer since 2007\\n\\n**What is your background in game development? Have you been doing it long?**\\nI think I have been dreaming about game development since my school days if not from my childhood. My first experience was Java 2ME, it was probably 2006 and I had a Siemens C65 cell phone. Later on I made several games using Flash and successfully sold them on auction to different sponsors. It was a very interesting experience because at some point I decided to collaborate with artists and music composers to make my games look and sound better and it felt\xa0like I was playing at real software development business but with low stakes. At some point it become clear that Flash is dying and I wanted to switch to something different. I was looking for a universal solution that is easy to try and not too platform specific. After some investigation I found [playcanvas.com](https://playcanvas.com).\xa0Game development is only one of my spare time activities. It\'s a hobby and it has never been a common specialty for me.\\n\\n**How long have you been using PlayCanvas?**\\nSince January, 2015\\n\\n**What led you to start using PlayCanvas?**\\nI watched all [your videos](http://youtube.com/user/playcanvas/) and checked most of [tutorials](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/). The feeling was that I can start doing something and getting the results with this platform very fast and it was\xa0true. I liked the idea that I didn\'t need to install anything - all I needed was a browser, so I decided to give it a chance.\\n\\n[![space_buggy_start](/img/space_buggy_start.png)](/img/space_buggy_start.png)\\n\\n> Try to start with some simple tasks. I\'ve seen a lot of guys who were trying to implement a very difficult game as a first project here. If you do that you will definitely fail.\\n\\n**You\u2019ve won two of our monthly game jams PLAYHACK. Congratulations! How do you decide what sort of game you are going to build for the PLAYHACK?**\\nThanks a lot! I like that you guys are giving us an initial kick with the model you provide for every PLAYHACK. Frankly, I\'m usually thinking about spending a minimal time effort to get a complete product within one month because it\'s kind of a motivation deadline for me. I\'ve abandoned a lot of very cool projects after this period because I get bored fast.\\n\\n**Tell us a bit about the design process you go through with the games?**\\nI think I spend first week prototyping and forming the overall concept, also checking some of the most risky points that I\'m not sure about. The next week is for the game process implementation. Third week is for UI and polishing and fourth\xa0is for bug-fixing and last minute changes based on the feedback\\n\\n**Are you an artist as well as a developer? How do you get artwork for you games?**\\nNope. I used to play the\xa0accordion when I was a kid. At the last year of my school and at university I experimented with electronic music and then I switched to games. I think I just need to create something all the time. As for\xa0the artwork - I\'m trying to use basic shapes and minimalistic style. If it\'s not possible I\'m searching for royalty free models and textures and adjusting them a little bit\\n\\n**Do you have future plans for Yet Another Gems and Space Buggy?**\\nI\'m going to try optimizing them to run faster on a limited hardware\\n\\n**What advice do you have for other people building games for PLAYHACK?**\\nTry to start with some simple tasks. I\'ve seen a lot of guys who were trying to implement a very difficult game as a first project here. If you do that you will definitely fail and feel very demotivated afterwards. Getting the results and seeing things work as you wanted - that\'s the best motivation, at least for me. And motivation is a \'must have\' if you make games\\n\\n**What would be your dream game to develop?**\\nNot sure about the genre but it should be a dark space game with a lot of metal and scary robots\\n\\n_Thanks to Rustam for taking the time to talk to us. You try his\xa0winning PLAYHACK entries, [Yet Another Gems](https://playcanv.as/p/p87UuuNV) and [Space Buggy](https://playcanv.as/p/3RerJIcy)\xa0on PlayCanvas.

Less API to remember, more time coding your game.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nTwo major changes landed today. A new way to add components and\xa0replacing the old `ApplicationContext` object with the `Application`.\\n\\n## Adding Components\\n\\nThe `Entity` class now has `addComponent` and `removeComponent`. This makes\xa0setting up an Entity in code much easier\\n\\n```javascript\\n    var entity = new pc.Entity();\\n    entity.addComponent(\\"light\\");\\n    entity.addComponent(\\"camera\\", {\\n        clearColor: new pc.Color(1, 0, 0);\\n    });\\n    app.root.addChild(entity);\\n```\\n\\nYou\'ll see that this is much less code than the previous way of doing stuff.\\n\\n## ApplicationContext\xa0removed\\n\\nUntil today, script instances would have the `ApplicationContext` available to them. Now we\'ve combined the `ApplicationContext` and the `Application`.\\n\\nHow does this effect your code? Well, actually it doesn\'t. We\'ve moved all the functionality from the ApplicationContext into Application and we now pass the `pc.Application` into your script. This is just reducing the API surface area.\\n\\nWhen you create a new script. Now you\'ll see this as the default skeleton script:\\n\\n```javascript\\npc.script.create(\'myscript\', function (app) {\\n    // Creates a new MyScript instance\\n    var MyScript = function (entity) {\\n        this.entity = entity;\\n    };\\n\\n    MyScript.prototype = {\\n        initialize: function () {\\n        },\\n\\n        update: function (dt) {\\n        }\\n    };\\n\\n    return MyScript;\\n});\\n```\\n\\nSo, now just use `app` instead of `context`.\\n\\nAnyway, that\'s it for this update. See you next time."},{"id":"build-a-game-for-a-loved-one-this-month","metadata":{"permalink":"/build-a-game-for-a-loved-one-this-month","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2015-02-01-build-a-game-for-a-loved-one-this-month.md","source":"@site/blog/2015-02-01-build-a-game-for-a-loved-one-this-month.md","title":"Build a game for a loved one this month.","description":"Our most popular PLAYHACK ever finishes today.

There really has never been a better time to join us! So without further ado, here\u2019s a look back at PlayCanvas and the Games industry in 2014 and glance ahead into the new year.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n[![SWOOOP background](/img/background-small.png)](/img/background-small.png)\\n\\n### Open-source\\n\\nThe entire runtime engine is available right now on [GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine) under the lovely [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/). Which means you can download it, fork it, and generally use it for anything you like.\\n\\n### Asset Store\\n\\nWe recently announced the PlayCanvas Asset Store, which is a huge deal for us. As the PlayCanvas Store grows we should hope to see thousands of game ready assets become available to our community. Try the beta for free at [https://store.playcanvas.com/](https://store.playcanvas.com/).\\n\\n### Physically Based Rendering\\n\\nUp until now PBR has only been available in the domain of AAA console and PC gaming. We\u2019re excited to announce that PBR is coming to PlayCanvas.\\n\\nRight now, it is possible for all PlayCanvas users to create this kind of content, but some of the steps need to performed in code. Our next goal is to integrate these steps directly into the toolset to allow you to build and iterate even faster.\\n\\n[![Star Lord Fan art using PBR in PlayCanvas](/img/shadingComparison2.jpg)](/img/shadingComparison2.jpg)  \\n_Star Lord Fan art using PBR in PlayCanvas_\\n\\n### Complete Website Redesign\\n\\nOver the past year we have also been busy redesigning our virtual home, playcanvas.com. We\u2019ve focused on increasing the speed of browsing on the site and functionality. Now it\u2019s fast and intuitive to use, giving you more time to work on your game!\\n\\n### DevLogs\\n\\nEvery PlayCanvas project now has a DevLog. Think of the DevLog as part commit message, part blog and part twitter stream. Use it to let other people know what you\u2019ve been working on.\\n\\n### Watch and Star Projects\\n\\nWatching a project shows your interest, and your news feed will feature updates from any watched projects. With Starring you won\u2019t receive any information, but it just tells the project owner that you think it\u2019s cool.\\n\\n### Particle System\\n\\nThe particle component is our newest engine component type. Our new particle system runs on the GPU for blazing performance on all devices including mobiles. It\'s all packaged up into an artist friendly editor panel where you can modify the curves to create the exact effect you want. From explosions and smoke to magical effects.\\n\\n### iOS Export\\n\\nIt\u2019s just one click to get a XCode project which is easy to build into a iPhone application. This feature allows our Pro Account holders to make their projects as viral and shareable as they are fun to play.\\n\\n### Material Editing\\n\\nHard to remember a time before we had Material Editing. This year we deploy the Material Editing feature in the PlayCanvas Designer. This lets you customize the look of your models. And recently it\'s getting more and more advanced in particular with our new Physical Material type.\\n\\n### SWOOOP\\n\\nWay back in March we unveiled SWOOOP, an endless flying game created by 2 team members in 4 weeks. This is our flagship game showing the capabilities of WebGL, but following our new PBR feature the sky really is the limit with PlayCanvas.\\n\\n[![SWOOOP in Designer](/img/designer-swooop.png)](/img/designer-swooop.png)  \\n_The SWOOOP project is open to everyone_\\n\\n### TANX\\n\\nIn July, a PlayCanvas user walked away a prize winner in a game jam with his game ColorTanks. In around 8 hours the developer had created an incredibly addictive multi player game, that has been played by over 12,000 gamers.\\n\\n### PLAYHACK\\n\\nTowards the end of this year we started our own game jam, the PLAYHACK. Running the competition monthly, we provide you the model, you make a game with it and our favorite is featured on the PlayCanvas site.\\n\\n## Things to look forward to in 2015\\n\\n### Physically-Based Rendering Workflow\\n\\nAs we progress the new PBR feature in the PlayCanvas Engine, making visually stunning games with \'AAA grade\' graphics will become easier than ever before. Pretty exciting stuff!\\n\\n### Massive Editor Improvements\\n\\nWe have a lot planned with regards to the Editor, so stay tuned. If PlayCanvas wasn\'t your favorite engine before it will be next year.\\n\\n### Enhanced Store\\n\\nThough the current iteration of the PlayCanvas Store only has around 40 models, soon\xa0we\u2019ll be giving all of our PlayCanvas users the chance to become vendors, opening up their assets to over 20,000 PlayCanvas game developers. In time, the PlayCanvas Store will be a fully functioning marketplace for the PlayCanvas Community.\\n\\n## What Do You Want To See?"},{"id":"playhack-december-collecting-presents","metadata":{"permalink":"/playhack-december-collecting-presents","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2014-12-22-playhack-december-collecting-presents.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-12-22-playhack-december-collecting-presents.md","title":"PLAYHACK December - Collecting Presents","description":"**PLAYHACK** is our fun monthly game building session.

As always, you can check out all the up to date code [in this project](https://playcanvas.com/project/333523/overview/playhack_december).\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" src=\\"https://playcanv.as/b/MjlE6fOY/\\" title=\\"360 lookaround camera\\" webkitallowfullscreen=\\"true\\" mozallowfullscreen=\\"true\\" allow=\\"autoplay\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\" allowvr=\\"\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n_Use W and S to move the sleigh._\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we\'re going to do two things - delete the presents as they go off-screen, and find out when the presents collide with Santa. How are we going to do all this? The answer: **Trigger Volumes**!\\n\\n## Adding an Offscreen Trigger Volume\\n\\nAt the moment, when presents go offscreen, they just keep going on and on forever and ever. We don\'t need the presents anymore after they\'ve gone offscreen, so it doesn\'t hurt (and may even help) us if we delete them. So, we need a way to test when a present has left the screen. We can do that with a Trigger Volume placed just offscreen.\\n\\n[![DEC-PLAYHACK-TUT3-2](/img/DEC-PLAYHACK-TUT3-2.png)](/img/DEC-PLAYHACK-TUT3-2.png)\\n\\nYou may be thinking - what is a trigger volume?! A trigger volume is simply an **entity with a collision component** added to it (but without a rigidbody - we\'ll get to that later). They allow us to test when rigidbodies enter and leave them - which is perfect for testing when a present goes off-screen.\\n\\nSo, to add the off-screen trigger volume, simply right click on\xa0\\"Santa\\" in the Pack Explorer and add a new Entity. I called mine \\"offscreen\\". Then, add a collision component to your new offscreen entity - a small blue cube should appear in the editor. Now, all we need to do is move it off-screen, and resize it so it catches all the presents. You can move it with the translate tool, and to make it big enough, you can edit the \\"half-extents\\" of the collision component until it covers the whole of the edge of the camera.\\n\\n[![DEC-PLAYHACK-TUT3-3](/img/DEC-PLAYHACK-TUT3-3.png)](/img/DEC-PLAYHACK-TUT3-3.png)\\n\\nNow, let\'s write\xa0some code to delete the presents that come off-screen. Add a script component to the offscreen entity, and add a new script - I called the script \\"offscreen.js\\" (creative name, I know).\\n\\nWhenever a rigidbody enters the trigger volume, the collision component will fire an event that we can listen to. Or, in simple terms, we can tell the collision component to call a specific function any time it comes into contact with a rigidbody. Put the following code in the initialize function of your new script:\\n\\n```javascript\\nthis.entity.collision.on(\'triggerenter\', this.onTriggerEnter, this);\\n```\\n\\nThis tells our collision component that when the \\"**triggerenter**\\" event happens (i.e. something enters the trigger volume), call the function \\"**onTriggerEnter**\\", in the scope of **this** (so we have access to all our variables and functions).\xa0Let\'s write that function now:\\n\\n```javascript\\nonTriggerEnter: function (other) {\\n    other.destroy();\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPretty simple huh? The onTriggerEnter function gets called with one argument, which is the entity it collided with. We simply destroy that entity, and it\'s gone!\\n\\n## Setting up the present\\n\\n[![DEC-PLAYHACK-TUT3-1](/img/DEC-PLAYHACK-TUT3-1.png)](/img/DEC-PLAYHACK-TUT3-1.png)\\n\\nIf we run the game now though, the presents still won\'t get deleted even if they go off-screen!\xa0That\'s because trigger volumes only check for collisions with rigidbodies, so we\'ll need to add some more components to the present. We need to add a **collision** component and a\xa0**kinematic\xa0rigidbody** component. Together, these will allow us to check when the present passes through our trigger volumes.\\n\\nSo, add those components to the\xa0Gift. Make sure you change the \\"type\\" attribute of the rigidbody component to **Kinematic** - we don\'t want it to be Static, because then we couldn\'t move the presents, and we don\'t need it to be **Dynamic** because then our present would get affected by gravity and physics and we don\'t need that.\xa0**Kinematic** allows us to move our present in code, but not have it affected by physics. You can fiddle around with the half extents of the collision box until it fits around the present too.\\n\\nYou\'ll also notice the collision box isn\'t centred on the present model. To fix this, you can removed the model component from Gift and add a model entity child instead, which you can then translate without affecting the position of the collision box.\\n\\nOne last thing - it\'s very important that you uncheck the Enabled attribute of the Gift. If the original gift goes off-screen and\xa0collides with the off-screen Trigger Volume, it will get deleted, and we won\'t be able to make any copies of it. We can make sure that never happens by disabling\xa0the present - now the original present won\'t do anything, but it will still be there for us to clone and make more presents.\\n\\nIf you test the game now, the presents should be getting deleted after they go off-screen! You can test that it\'s actually working by moving the\xa0off-screen Trigger Volume on-screen a bit - the presents should then disappear just before they go off-screen.\\n\\n## Santa Trigger Volume\\n\\nBut the present going offscreen isn\'t the only thing we want to check for - we also need to check when it collides with Santa! Luckily, this is very similar to the offscreen trigger volume.\\n\\nLike before, we need to add a collision component - so right click on Santa and add one. There\'s a clever thing we can do here: instead of messing around with the half-extends of the collision box, trying to get it to match Santa, we can simply tell the collision component to match the size and shape of the Santa Model. Change the type attribute of the collision component to **Mesh**, and select the Santa_sleigh model for the **Asset**. Now, the collision will only check for exactly the right size of Santa.\\n\\nWondering why we can\'t use a Mesh\xa0for the collision component of Gift? Checking for collisions between two\xa0Meshes is a lot more computationally expensive compared to comparing collisions with simple geometry. Therefore, checking for a collision between two Meshes isn\'t allowed, and since our present is basically a cube, we\'re using a cube for the collision volume of the present.\\n\\nNow we just need to add a small amount of code to Santa so we know when presents collide with him.\\n\\n```javascript\\nthis.entity.collision.on(\'triggerenter\', this.onTriggerEnter, this);\\n```\\n\\nPut that line in the santa_controller.js script - it does exactly the same thing as before. We\'re going to write a simple onTriggerEnter function for now, and actually write the functionality we want next time.\\n\\n```javascript\\nonTriggerEnter:function(other) {\\n    if (other.name === \\"Gift\\") {\\n        other.destroy();\\n        // we\'ll be adding score incrementing and other stuff here...\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAll we\'re doing\xa0here at the moment is the same as the offscreen trigger volume - destroying the present when it comes into contact with Santa.\\n\\nAnd that\'s it for this time! Next time we\'ll be looking at adding a GUI to the game so you can see how many presents you\'ve collected!"},{"id":"playhack-december-creating-presents","metadata":{"permalink":"/playhack-december-creating-presents","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2014-12-12-playhack-december-creating-presents.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-12-12-playhack-december-creating-presents.md","title":"PLAYHACK December - Creating Presents","description":"**PLAYHACK** is our fun monthly game building session.

We\'re also going to make the presents rotate, just because it looks nice. To do that, we need to attach a new script to the Gift entity, just like we did last time with Santa. Call it something like \'gift_controller\'.\\n\\nNow, let\'s think about what we need - just like with Santa\'s script, we\'re going to need the speed we want the presents to move, and we\'ll also need the speed we want the presents to rotate. So let\'s make two attributes for that:\\n\\n```javascript\\npc.script.attribute(\\"speed\\", \\"number\\", 10);\\npc.script.attribute(\\"rotspeed\\", \\"number\\", 90);\\n```\\n\\nPut them at the top of the script like before (remember to do _Entity > Refresh Script Attributes_ when you come to test!).\\n\\nNow we need to move the gift every frame. This is again, very similar to the Santa movement code:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Called every frame, dt is time in seconds since last update\\nupdate: function (dt) {\\n    this.entity.translate(0, 0, -this.speed*dt);\\n    this.entity.rotate(0, this.rotspeed*dt, 0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo move the present, we use the `entity.translate` function, as before. To rotate, we use the `entity.rotate` function, which as its name suggests, rotates the present by a certain amount.\\n\\nIf you launch the game (remembering to do _Entity > Refresh Script Attributes_!) then the present in the middle of the screen should hopefully move offscreen whilst rotating. Success!\\n\\n### Creating Many Presents\\n\\n[![Many Presents](/img/Screen-Shot-2014-11-24-at-15.58.42.png)](/img/Screen-Shot-2014-11-24-at-15.58.42.png)\\n\\nNow, we\'ll need to create a script that will create presents every so often off the right hand edge of the screen. This might seem odd - up until now we\'ve only created scripts that do things to entities already on screen. To do this, we\'re going to attach a script to the root entity of the game - which is the entity called \\"Santa\\" in the pack explorer. Add a script to the root entity called \'gift_creator\'.\\n\\nSo, let\'s think about how to go about this. We\'ve got quite a few things to think about. Firstly, how do we add new presents? We can achieve this by cloning the gift that\'s already on screen. To do this, we need a reference to that present. In the `initialize` method, add the following code:\\n\\n```javascript\\nthis.gift = context.root.findByName(\\"Gift\\");\\n```\\n\\nNow we have a variable, `this.gift`, which contains the gift that is on screen. We\'ll get on to how to clone it in a second.\\n\\nWhat else do we have to think about? Two main things - where we want to add the new presents, and how often we want to add them. We\'re going to have an element of randomness to where and when we add the presents - we want the presents to come in from the right at different heights, and we also don\'t want the presents to come in like clockwork - we want to keep the player on his toes and have them spawn with slightly different amounts of time between them.\\n\\nWe\'ll add some new attributes so we can easily test and change these things:\\n\\n```javascript\\npc.script.attribute(\\"avgPresentTime\\", \\"number\\", 0.75);\\npc.script.attribute(\\"presentRange\\", \\"number\\", 0.5);\\npc.script.attribute(\\"maxY\\", \\"number\\", 8);\\npc.script.attribute(\\"offscreenZ\\", \\"number\\", 20);\\n```\\n\\n`avgPresentTime` is the average amount of time between each present coming spawning,\xa0and `presentRange` is how many seconds around the average time presents could come in. `maxY` is the highest position a present could come in at, and `offscreenZ` is the z position we are going to create our new presents at.\\n\\nSo, now we\'ve got all these attributes, what do we need to do? We need some sort of timer than allows us to check whether or not to add a new present yet. Let\'s add some variables so we can do that:\\n\\n```javascript\\ninitialize: function () {\\n    this.gift = context.root.findByName(\\"Gift\\");\\n    this.presentTimer = 0;\\n    this.presentTimeToGet = 0;\\n},\\n```\\n\\nThe first line we added earlier - but we\'ve now got two new variables, `presentTimer` and `presentTimeToGet`. We will use `presentTimer` to count how long it\'s been since we last added a present, and `presentTimeToGet` will be how long we need to wait until adding the next present.\\n\\nSo, we now know that every frame, we need to increment `this.presentTimer` by the amount of time passed since the last frame - which is helpfully passed into the `update` function as the variable `dt`.\\n\\n```javascript\\nupdate: function (dt) {\\n    this.presentTimer += dt;\\n    if(this.presentTimer >= this.presentTimeToGet) {\\n        //Create a new gift\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSo, now we know when we\'re adding a new gift. To add a new gift to the game, we can use the following code:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar newGift = this.gift.clone();\\nnewGift.enabled = true;\\ncontext.root.addChild(newGift);\\n```\\n\\nThis clones `this.gift`, and stores the new gift in the variable `newGift`. We then have to do two things to actually get the gift in game - we have to enable it, and then add it to the entity hierarchy.\\n\\nNow we have a new gift in the game - however, it\'s at the same position as the first gift! That\'s not good. We want it to be offscreen at a random height to start with! Let\'s fix that.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Set its position correctly\\nvar rand = Math.random() * 2 - 1;\\nvar newY = rand * maxY;\\nnewGift.setPosition(0, newY, this.offscreenZ);\\n```\\n\\nThere\'s a few new things going on here! First, let\'s look at the randomness. `Math.random()` is a built in JavaScript function that returns a random number from 0 to 1. We, however, want a random number from `maxY` to negative `maxY`. To achieve this, we multiply our random number by 2 (giving us a number between 0 and 2), then take away 1 (between -1 and 1), then multiply it by maxY (between `-maxY` and `maxY`). Once we have the random `newY` position, we can set the position of the `newGift`.\\n\\nNow, we\'re very almost done. However, we\'ve now added a present, so we need to reset `presentTimer` to 0, as it\'s been 0 seconds since we added a present! We also want to change `presentTimeToGet`, as we want to wait a slightly different length of time before adding another present.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// And reset the timer\\nthis.presentTimer = 0;\\nthis.presentTimeToGet = this.avgPresentTime + this.presentRange * (Math.random() - 0.5);\\n```\\n\\nWe use `Math.random()` again here to get the time before we want to add another present. This gives us a number that will be no more than half of `presentRange` away from `avgPresentTime`.\\n\\nThat should be it! Test your code (REMEMBER _Entity Menu > Refresh Script Attributes_), and presents should start coming in from the right. Perfect!\\n\\n### Housekeeping\\n\\nOne last thing - we\'ve left the sack floating in the middle of the screen, and we don\'t really want the first present to start in the middle of the screen either.\xa0To fix this, simply select the gift/sack, and uncheck the \'Enabled\' attribute. That\'s it! The initial sack and gift will no longer\xa0show up in the editor or when you test the game.\\n\\nNext time, we\'ll be looking at [Trigger Volumes](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/collision-and-triggers/), which will allow us to have Santa actually collect the presents when he touches them."},{"id":"physically-based-rendering-comes-to-webgl","metadata":{"permalink":"/physically-based-rendering-comes-to-webgl","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2014-12-10-physically-based-rendering-comes-to-webgl.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-12-10-physically-based-rendering-comes-to-webgl.md","title":"Physically Based Rendering comes to WebGL","description":"If you\'re working with real-time 3D, chances are that you want your scenes to look physically accurate.\xa0For many years, graphics engines have relied on a non-physical approximations without respect to energy conservation and had problems with properly decoupling lighting from the actual material properties.

Games like Watch Dogs, Assassin\'s Creed: Unity and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare all feature PBR engines. **Today, we\'re excited to announce that PBR is coming to PlayCanvas.** Both web developers and game creators can now look forward to a high-level online toolset to build stunningly beautiful 3D scenes using WebGL.\\n\\n![shadingComparison2](/img/shadingComparison2.jpg)\\n\\nOver the past 3 years since PlayCanvas started, we\'ve seen WebGL adoption skyrocket. It\'s now supported in every major browser, both on mobile and the desktop. Current [statistics](https://caniuse.com/webgl) show that 82.7% of web users have the ability to run WebGL content, and this number continues to rise. The PlayCanvas \'Star-Lord Demo\' shows that WebGL is perfectly capable of implementing PBR and other high-end graphical features.\\n\\n### Coming Soon\\n\\nRight now, it is possible for all PlayCanvas users to create this kind of content, but some of the steps need to performed in code. Our next goal is to integrate these steps directly into the toolset to allow you to build and iterate even faster.\\n\\nThe open source PlayCanvas engine has taken a quantum leap forwards and we couldn\'t be more excited to make this technology available to you. Look for more announcements about our PBR support in the coming weeks.

Crazy we know, but this grand prize is for good reason. **Your prize is your product**.\\n\\n### Ludum Dare 31 and PlayCanvas\\n\\nOver the past weekend there was some great developing happening with PlayCanvas in the Ludum Dare. You can find the projects on our explore page but these incredible developers endured espionage grade sleep deprivation and probably experienced the full spectrum of human emotion. So for their efforts, we\'ll happily give their creations some love.\\n\\n**The theme for LD31 was \'Entire Game On One Screen\'**.\\n\\nPlayCanvas user [FELLADRIN](https://playcanvas.com/user/felladrin)\xa0made a colorful and thoroughly addictive\xa0balloon grabbing game\xa0called [Ora Bolas!](https://playcanv.as/p/tfHfJdt7/) (seen below).\\n\\n[![Ora Bolas](/img/ld31-ora-bolas.png)](https://playcanv.as/p/tfHfJdt7/)\\n\\n[CREFOSSUS](https://playcanvas.com/user/crefossus) incorporated sky high teddy bears and computer brain interfaces in his **3D conceptual game**.

Press SPACE to switch to mouse control._\\n\\nIn the coming weeks, I\'ll be taking you through how to make a complete game in PlayCanvas - from very beginning to very end, with only basic programming knowledge required!\\n\\nWe\'re going to be making a side-scrolling endless runner game, where Santa must pick up presents and avoid various things to deliver presents on time! However, the techniques we\'ll be using will be applicable to many kinds of games.\\n\\n![Santa](/img/playhack-santa.jpg)\\n\\nTo follow along with this tutorial, fork the [PLAYHACK December project](https://playcanvas.com/project/333365/overview/playhack-dec-14)\xa0to get started. To see what we\u2019ll be making this time, [look here](https://playcanvas.com/project/333872/overview/playhack_tut1). Or just check out the embedded app\xa0above.\\n\\nSo you\'ve forked the repository and got it open in the editor. We\'re going to need to make a few changes to start making our game.\\n\\n## Camera\\n\\nFirstly, the camera. There are two camera types in PlayCanvas - Perspective and Orthographic. Perspective is what you want for most 3D games \u2013 it\u2019s how things look in life.\\nHowever, our game is pretty much 2D - which means an Orthographic projection would be best for us. To make the switch, select the Camera in the Pack Explorer, then in the Attribute Editor on the right, change Projection from \\"Perspective\\" to \\"Orthographic.\\"\\n\\nIf you test now by pressing the Launch button, you\'ll see that Santa is tiny in the middle of the screen! That\'s not what we want. We can fix this by reducing the Ortho Height attribute of the camera. Reduce it from 100 down to about 10, and now check the game. Santa\'s now a much better size!\\n\\n## Player\\n\\n[![Santa](/img/editor-santa.jpg)](/img/editor-santa.jpg)\\n\\nNow, we want Santa to start on the left of the screen, looking right. To make things easier for us, we\'ll align our camera along the Z-axis so that moving things around on screen becomes easier for us later.\\n\\nTo do that, set the camera position to 0, 0, 10, and the rotation to 0, 0, 0. Santa should now be looking right at the camera in the middle of the screen. You can use the rotate and translate tools in the editor to move him to the right place, or you can select Santa_sleigh from the Pack Explorer and set his position to -17, 0, 0 and his rotation to 0, 90, 0. Great! Take a look at the game again. Santa\'s now in the right place, facing the right way. Lovely.\\n\\nLet\'s get Santa moving. We\'re going to create two ways for Santa to move - by mouse and by keyboard. Let\'s create a new script, called Santa_Controller, and attach it to the Santa_sleigh entity we have.\\n\\nTo do this, right click on Santa_sleigh in the Pack Explorer, and select Add Component > Script. Now we can attach scripts to Santa. To attach a new script to Santa, simply type the name of the new script (in our case, \\"Santa_Controller\\") in the URL box of the Script Attribute we just added to Santa.\\n\\n## Player Controller\\n\\nNow we\'ve created the new script and attached it to Santa, let\'s edit it and make Santa do something! Click on the blue Santa_Controller.js link that should have appeared below the URL box to get editing!\\n\\nYou\'ll be greeted by a new script that should look like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\npc.script.create(\'Santa_Controller\', function (context) {\\n    // Creates a new Santa_Controller instance\\n    var Santa_Controller = function (entity) {\\n        this.entity = entity;\\n    };\\n\\n    Santa_Controller.prototype = {\\n        // Called once after all resources are loaded\\n        initialize: function () {\\n        },\\n\\n        // Called every frame, dt is time in seconds since last update\\n        update: function (dt) {\\n        }\\n    };\\n\\n    return Santa_Controller;\\n});\\n```\\n\\nLet\u2019s think about what we need to do to make Santa move up and down. Well, we\u2019ll need the speed we want him to move \u2013 so let\u2019s put that as an attribute so we can change it easily.\\n\\n```javascript\\npc.script.attribute(\\"speed\\", \\"number\\", 10);\\npc.script.create(\'Santa_Controller\', function (context) {\\n```\\n\\nNow, let\u2019s make 2 functions \u2013 one that moves Santa up, and one that moves Santa down.\\n\\n```javascript\\n    // Called every frame, dt is time in seconds since last update\\n    update: function (dt) {\\n    },\\n\\n    moveUp: function(dt) {\\n        this.entity.translate(0, this.speed * dt, 0);\\n    },\\n\\n    moveDown: function(dt) {\\n        this.entity.translate(0, -this.speed * dt, 0);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThe `translate` function is one that all entities have, and simply moves the entity by a specified amount. In this case, we want Santa to move up or down by the speed, multiplied by the amount of time passed in the current frame. We do this so that Santa will move the same speed however fast our game is running!\\n\\n## Keyboard Controls\\n\\nNow, let\u2019s look at keyboard controls. To do anything with the keyboard in PlayCanvas, we need to use `context.keyboard`. `context` is available in all scripts, and allows us access to all the data our game has to offer \u2013 in this case, we need the keyboard, which deals with keyboard input.\\n\\nWe can use `context.keyboard.isPressed` to check if specific keys are pressed \u2013 if W or S are pressed, we\u2019ll move Santa up or down accordingly. We\u2019ll need to check every frame, so put the following code in the update function:\\n\\n```javascript\\nif (context.keyboard.isPressed(pc.input.KEY_W)) {\\n    this.moveUp(dt);\\n}\\nif (context.keyboard.isPressed(pc.input.KEY_S)) {\\n    this.moveDown(dt);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBefore we test the game, however, there\u2019s something we need to do. The editor needs to be told when we add an attribute to a script, so back in the editor, and go _Entity > Refresh Script Attributes_. A box should come up underneath our Santa_Controller.js script allowing us to change the speed of Santa.\\n\\nNow test the game \u2013 we should be able to move Santa up and down now using the W and S keys! Change the speed in the editor until you find something that feels fun.\\n\\n## Mouse Controls\\n\\nThat\u2019s all good, however, we want the option of using the mouse or the keyboard! Let\u2019s add another attribute in our script that will allow us to change between mouse and keyboard when testing:\\n\\n```javascript\\npc.script.attribute(\\"keyboard\\", \\"boolean\\", true);\\n```\\n\\nIf you do _Entity > Refresh Script Attributes_ again, you\u2019ll see another attribute that we can change, and this time it\u2019s a check box. That\u2019s all a Boolean is \u2013 a true or a false value. Either off or on. If keyboard is ticked we\u2019ll use the keyboard input, and if it\u2019s not we\u2019ll use the mouse.\\n\\nTo do things with the mouse in PlayCanvas, we have to use \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 `context.mouse`! Mouse input is going to be slightly more work than keyboard, but we\u2019ll be okay. We need to get the position of the mouse on screen, compare it to Santa\u2019s position, and move Santa towards the mouse.\\n\\nSo, we\u2019ll need a variable to store the mouse position, and we\u2019ll also need some way of getting the mouse position. For that, we\u2019ll need a listener.\\n\\nA listener is simply a function that we define, that gets called by a specific event. In this example, the event we want to \u201clisten\u201d for is the mouse moving.\\n\\nSo, let\u2019s set this up:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Called once after all resources are loaded\\ninitialize: function () {\\n    //Used to store the mouse position\\n    this.pos = new pc.Vec3();\\n    context.mouse.on(pc.input.EVENT_MOUSEMOVE, this.onMouseMove, this);\\n},\\n```\\n\\nWe\u2019ve got a variable called `pos` that we\u2019ll store the current mouse position in. The next line is what creates our listener. We\u2019re saying when there\u2019s a mouse move event, we want a function called `onMouseMove` to execute. Let\u2019s write that function now:\\n\\n```javascript\\nmoveDown: function(dt) {\\n    this.entity.translate(0, -this.speed * dt, 0);\\n},\\n\\nonMouseMove: function () {\\n    // Use the camera component\'s screenToWorld function to convert the\\n    // position of the mouse into a position in 3D space\\n    var depth = 10;\\n    var cameraEntity = context.root.findByName(\'Camera\');\\n    cameraEntity.camera.screenToWorld(event.x, event.y, depth, this.pos);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the `onMouseMove` function, which gets called every time the mouse moves, we have to do some work to get the position we need. Because the mouse is only on a 2D screen, we have to look at use the camera\u2019s `screenToWorld` function to get the position we want.\\n\\nHave a look at this [mouse tutorial](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/mouse-input/) if you want to know more about how this works!\\n\\nNow we\u2019ve got the position of the mouse in `this.pos` \u2013 we can use that to move Santa! Let\u2019s update our `update` function:\\n\\n```javascript\\nupdate: function (dt) {\\n    if(this.keyboard) {\\n        if(context.keyboard.isPressed(pc.input.KEY_W)) {\\n            this.moveUp(dt);\\n        }\\n        if(context.keyboard.isPressed(pc.input.KEY_S)) {\\n            this.moveDown(dt);\\n        }\\n    } else {\\n        if(this.pos.y > this.entity.getPosition().y) {\\n            this.moveUp(dt);\\n        }\\n        if(this.pos.y < this.entity.getPosition().y) {\\n            this.moveDown(dt);\\n        }\\n    }\\n},\\n```\\n\\nFirst things first - we now check to see if we\u2019re using keyboard or mouse.

In turn have also deployed a **cubemap editor** which allows you to create cubemaps by assigning 6 images to each slot of the cube. To **make your materials appear reflective** you can reference a cubemap, then the material will reflect the sides of the cube (pending that you assign a cubemap to the Reflection section of a material).\\n\\n#### Skybox Scene Setting\\n\\nWe also support Scene Skyboxes.\xa0Before if you wanted to make a skybox you needed an Entity with a skybox component, but now you can **create a cubemap** and then **assign that cubemap to the skybox slot** in the Scene Settings.\\n\\n#### Material Upgrades\\n\\nWe\'ve deployed more and more interesting features to the material editor. Look out for more big things happening here.\\n\\n#### Particles\\n\\nOur particle system beta is moving forwards. We\'re getting close to releasing this for everyone.

Now we going to add separate controls to\xa0rotate the tanks turret. You\xa0try [this project](https://playcanvas.com/project/331485/overview/playhack-nov-14) for yourself by running [this scene](https://playcanvas.com/editor/scene/342714).\\n\\n```javascript\\ninitialize: function () {\\n    this.turret = this.entity.findByName(\\"Tank_gun_turret\\");\\n    this.bullet = context.root.findByName(\\"Bullet\\");\\n    this.barrel = context.root.findByName(\\"Barrel\\");\\n},\\n\\nupdate: function (dt) {\\n    // Rotate the turret left and right using A and D\\n    if (context.keyboard.isPressed(pc.input.KEY_A)) {\\n        this.turret.rotate(0, this.speed * dt, 0);\\n    } else if(context.keyboard.isPressed(pc.input.KEY_D)) {\\n        this.turret.rotate(0, -this.speed * dt, 0);\\n    }\\n\\n    if (context.keyboard.wasPressed(pc.input.KEY_S)) {\\n        this.shoot();\\n    }\\n},\\n```\\n\\nThis is the code in **turretcontrols.js**. It\'s very simple. In the initialize function we find the Entity called **Tank_gun_turret**. This Entity is the\xa0separate model for the gun turret. Then each frame we check to see if the A or D key is pressed and we rotate the turret to the left or right using the `rotate()` method on the Entity.\\n\\n### Shooting Bullets\\n\\n```javascript\\nshoot: function () {\\n    var bullet = this.bullet.clone();\\n    context.root.addChild(bullet);\\n    bullet.setPosition(this.barrel.getPosition());\\n    bullet.enabled = true;\\n\\n    this.force = new pc.Vec3();\\n    this.force.copy(this.turret.forward);\\n    this.force.scale(-this.impulse);\\n\\n    bullet.rigidbody.applyImpulse(this.force);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTake a look at the `shoot()` function\xa0above. This is called when the player presses the S key. It introduces a few different concepts:\\n\\n#### `Entity.clone()`\\n\\nThe `clone()`\xa0method on Entities creates a complete copy of the Entity and its components. When you clone an\xa0Entity it is created but not added into the scene hierarchy so you have to call the\xa0`addChild()` method and add it to the parent of your choice. In this case, we\'re just adding it to the root.\\n\\n#### Enabling and Disabling Entities\\n\\nThe bullet Entity we are cloning from is\xa0**disabled** in the Designer because we don\'t want this extra bullet in\xa0the scene.\xa0After we have cloned the Entity we want to enabled the bullet which means that the model component is enabled (it start\'s rendering) and the rigidbody is enabled (it starts simulating/colliding).\\n\\nTo fire the bullet, we clone it, add it into the hierarchy and set it\'s position to the location of the gun barrel entity.\xa0After we\'ve enabled the bullet, we apply an impulse to kick it off in the direction of the turret.\\n\\n### Target Practice\\n\\n[![PLAYHACK_boxes](/img/PLAYHACK_boxes.jpg)](/img/PLAYHACK_boxes.jpg)\\n\\nFinally we\'ve just added some boxes for target practice. The boxes are simply Entities with a dynamic rigidbody and a collision component.

You can make **any** game you like.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Camera Types\\n\\nThis blog post is going to cover a few different types of camera. We\'re also going to cover Script Attributes, which lets you expose values into the\xa0Designer.\\n\\nTry running the [Follow Camera Pack](https://playcanvas.com/editor/scene/343245) in this\xa0[Project](https://playcanvas.com/project/331849/overview/playhacknov)\xa0to see\xa0all this code in action.\xa0Use the arrow keys to move the tank and press the Spacebar to cycle between the different camera types.\\n\\n[![PlayCanvas](/img/playhack-tank.jpg)](/img/playhack-tank.jpg)\\n\\n### Fixed Follow Camera\\n\\nThe fixed follow camera is a type of third-person camera which follows the target at exactly the same distance and angle at all times. This type of camera is very easy to implement. In fact you\xa0*could*\xa0set it up just by setting the Camera entity as a child of the tank. We\'re going to show you how to do it in code though.\\n\\n```javascript\\nupdateFixedFollow: function (dt) {\\n    this.entity.setPosition(this.target.getPosition());\\n    this.entity.setRotation(this.target.getRotation());\\n    this.entity.rotateLocal(this.elevation, 0, 0);\\n    this.entity.translateLocal(0, 0, this.distance);\\n},\\n```\\n\\nThis function sets the camera to be at the same position and\xa0rotation as the target (the target in our code is the player\'s tank). Then we rotate by the `this.elevation` value and move the camera backwards (backwards is along positive z axis) by the `this.distance` value.\\n\\n**Try at home:** Try modifying the elevation and distance to setup up and overhead camera like the one in the picture.\\n\\n### Trailing Follow Camera\\n\\nThe trailing follow camera is a slightly more advanced form of third-person camera which follows the target, but it is always trying to catch up to where the fixed follow camera\xa0would be. This gives a smoother motion, but can lead to the camera loosing the player if\xa0it trails too much.\\n\\n```javascript\\nupdateTrailingFollow: function (dt) {\\n    var pos = new pc.Vec3();\\n    var rot = new pc.Quat();\\n\\n    // store initial position and rotation\\n    pos.copy(this.entity.getPosition());\\n    rot.copy(this.entity.getRotation());\\n\\n    // set entity to be at target position and rotation\\n    this.entity.setPosition(this.target.getPosition());\\n    this.entity.setRotation(this.target.getRotation());\\n    this.entity.rotateLocal(this.elevation, 0, 0);\\n    this.entity.translateLocal(0, 0, this.distance);\\n\\n    // interpolate start pos/rot to target pos/rot\\n    pos.lerp(pos, this.entity.getPosition(), this.positionFactor);\\n    rot.slerp(rot, this.entity.getRotation(), this.rotationFactor);\\n\\n    // Set to interpolated position\\n    this.entity.setPosition(pos);\\n    this.entity.setRotation(rot);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this function we store the current position and rotation, calculate the position of the fixed follow camera and then use `lerp()` and `slerp()` to interpolate the position. `lerp` and `slerp` stand for Linear intERPolation and Spherical Linear intERPolation. This is a way of moving between two values by\xa0supplying a value between 0 and 1. In this case we use the `positionFactor` and `rotationFactor` as the input to the interpolation.\\n\\nFinally we update the\xa0position and rotation to the\xa0final values.\\n\\nThis a very simple implementation of a trailing camera. There are all kinds of ways you can\xa0implement one. Another method is to use a\xa0spring simulation to attach the camera to the target point. Then you can adjust the stiffness of the spring to modify how much the camera trails.\\n\\n### Look At Camera\\n\\nThe final type of camera is a static\xa0look at camera.\xa0The camera never moves but just aims at the target.\\n\\n```javascript\\nupdateLookAt: function (dt) {\\n    this.entity.lookAt(this.target.getPosition());\\n},\\n```\\n\\nThis code needs no explanation.\\n\\n### Script Attributes\\n\\nThe final\xa0tip to share is how to use script attributes to expose values your code needs into the Designer.\\n\\n```javascript\\npc.script.attribute(\\"elevation\\", \\"number\\", -30);\\npc.script.attribute(\\"distance\\", \\"number\\", 5);\\npc.script.attribute(\\"positionFactor\\", \\"number\\", 0.2);\\npc.script.attribute(\\"rotationFactor\\", \\"number\\", 0.2);\\n```\\n\\nThis code at the top of the camera script, tells the designer to expose four values `elevation`, `distance`, `positionFactor` and\xa0`rotationFactor` and show them as editable numbers in the Designer.\\n\\nBack in the Designer, we need to load the script attributes from the script using the *Entity -> Refresh Script Attributes* menu item. Then we\'ll see this attribute block appear on\xa0the script component.\\n\\n[![PLAYHACK_Camera](/img/PLAYHACK_Camera.jpg)](/img/PLAYHACK_Camera.jpg)\\n\\nModifying these values will directly update the script live when it is running from the\xa0Designer. So you can tweak values with the live game\xa0running\xa0in a separate tab. This can really accelerate your development.\\n\\nThat\'s it for now. Don\'t forget you can try running the [Follow Camera Pack](https://playcanvas.com/editor/scene/343245) in this\xa0[Project](https://playcanvas.com/project/331849/overview/playhacknov)\xa0to see\xa0all this code in action.\xa0Use the arrow keys to move the tank and press the Spacebar to cycle between the different camera types.\\n\\n### PLAYHACK\\n\\nPLAYHACK is our monthly game jam.

This will give you an little introduction into the\xa0PlayCanvas physics system as well as reading keyboard input.\\n\\n[![tank](/img/tank.jpg)](/img/tank.jpg)\\n\\n### Setting up the Physics\\n\\nThe pack you started with has a tank entity set up. To add physics we need to add a rigidbody and a collision component. It\'s not quite that simple though, as we need to make sure that geometry lines up in the center of the collision body.\\n\\nHere is one way to set up the hierarchy:\\n\\n[![PLAYHACK_hierarchy](/img/PLAYHACK_hierarchy.jpg)](/img/PLAYHACK_hierarchy.jpg)\\n\\nThe **Tank**\xa0entity is setup with rigidbody and collision components. The **Geometry** entity is a container for the models and the light. We can position the **Geometry** entity so that it lines up in the center of our collision.\\n\\n[![PLAYHACK_attributes](/img/PLAYHACK_attributes.jpg)](/img/PLAYHACK_attributes.jpg)\\n\\nHere is the attribute panel for the **Tank** entity. You \xa0can see we\'ve set the collision shape to be a sphere, the rigidbody is dynamic and we\'ve\xa0set angular factor to [0, 1, 0] which means the sphere can only rotate around the y-axis.\\n\\nWe\'ve also\xa0added a ground collision box so the tank doesn\'t fall through the floor.\xa0After that, the only thing left to do is read the keyboard input.\\n\\n### Keyboard input\\n\\n```javascript\\npc.script.create(\'tankcontrols\', function (context) {\\n    // Creates a new Tankcontrols instance\\n    var Tankcontrols = function (entity) {\\n        this.entity = entity;\\n        this.force = new pc.Vec3();\\n    };\\n\\n    Tankcontrols.prototype = {\\n        // Called once after all resources are loaded\\n        initialize: function () {\\n        },\\n\\n        // Called every frame, dt is time in seconds since last update\\n        update: function (dt) {\\n            if (context.keyboard.isPressed(pc.input.KEY_LEFT)) {\\n                this.entity.rigidbody.applyTorque(0, 1, 0);\\n            }\\n            if (context.keyboard.isPressed(pc.input.KEY_RIGHT)) {\\n                this.entity.rigidbody.applyTorque(0, -1, 0);\\n            }\\n            if (context.keyboard.isPressed(pc.input.KEY_UP)) {\\n                this.force.copy(this.entity.forward).scale(10);\\n                this.entity.rigidbody.applyForce(this.force);\\n            }\\n            if (context.keyboard.isPressed(pc.input.KEY_DOWN)) {\\n                this.force.copy(this.entity.forward).scale(-10);\\n                this.entity.rigidbody.applyForce(this.force);\\n            }\\n\\n        }\\n    };\\n\\n    return Tankcontrols;\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThis script is attached to the\xa0**Tank** entity. It\'s pretty self-explanatory. Each\xa0frame, `update()` is called. This function checks to see if the any of the arrow keys on the keyboard have been pressed. If they have a force or torque is applied to the rigidbody attached to the entity.\\n\\n[Here is the Pack](https://playcanvas.com/dave/playhack-nov/designer/bootstrap?e=d3e2d116-641c-11e4-9aee-12313b0a5ec6&repository=true) with this already set up for you to try.

(Yeah, we know it\'s pretty hidden away at the moment, we\'re working on that).\\n\\nThink of the DevLog\xa0as part commit message, part blog, part twitter stream. Use it to let\xa0people know what you\'ve been working on. Perhaps each day you will do a update summary, maybe you\'ll do 5 a day, or one a week. Whatever works for you. People who come to your project page can read your\xa0log to find out about your project.\xa0In the coming weeks we\'ll be featuring log posts on the front page of the site so that\xa0everyone can see what is going on across PlayCanvas\'s thousands of users.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\nPrimary, the\xa0DevLog is a place for you to write about your game. But you\'re a creative bunch so we wanted to give you a\xa0little more than just a text box.\\n\\n### Markdown\\n\\nMarkdown is a simple way to let you add styles, links,\xa0images to your text.\xa0The [markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\xa0is easy to learn and remember. We don\'t host images (yet) so you\'ll have to make do with images that are already on the web somewhere else (for the moment).\\n\\n### Emoji\\n\\nEmoji\xa0is like smileys++. Use the [emoji cheat sheet](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/)\xa0and enter your emoji by including a keyword between to colons. Like :smile:\\n\\n### Preview\\n\\nUse the preview tab to see what your post will look like with all the styles, images and emoji.\\n\\nLet us know what you think of the new feature."},{"id":"intel-gives-html5-some-love-at-the-buzz-workshop","metadata":{"permalink":"/intel-gives-html5-some-love-at-the-buzz-workshop","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2014-10-06-intel-gives-html5-some-love-at-the-buzz-workshop.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-10-06-intel-gives-html5-some-love-at-the-buzz-workshop.md","title":"Intel gives HTML5 some love at the Buzz Workshop","description":"Last Thursday, Intel staged one heck of an awesome event in London Be Mobile\'.

It was essentially a mini-conference that consisted of talks given by industry experts, a panel and even an indie game pitch event.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIf you follow Intel closely, you\'ll know they are serious about HTML5. Very serious. That\'s why they have a\xa0[developer portal](https://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/home) dedicated to HTML5 technologies. \xa0One of these technologies is the XDK, a client-side application that generates multi-platform native builds of HTML5 apps and games in the cloud:\\n\\n[![XDK](/img/xdk.png)](/img/xdk.png)\\n\\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about the XDK is the shear number of platforms it can output builds for. Check out the interface showing all the options:\\n\\n[![XDK Builds](/img/xdk-builds.png)](/img/xdk-builds.png)\\n\\nEach of these builds can be generated at the touch of a button. Your HTML5 app is uploaded and crunched into a native app in the cloud, which can then be downloaded back to your host filesystem. Amazing!\\n\\nIf that wasn\'t impressive enough, they run [Crosswalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosswalk_Project), an open source project that uses a custom build of the Chromium project to build a native wrapper for HTML5 apps that can target Android and Tizen. The XDK actually uses Crosswalk internally, but you can use it independently if you wish. For example, you might want to run your own build process for your HTML5 games, in which case, integrating Crosswalk is...well, a walk in the park.\\n\\nThese technologies are sufficiently awe-inspiring that I wanted to talk about them at the conference. Intel kindly invited us along and I gave a talk called \'Friction Free Gaming\'.\\n\\n[![Buzz Workshop Talk](/img/buzz-workshop-talk.png)](/img/buzz-workshop-talk.png)\\n\\nThe main theme was that HTML5 and WebGL are enabling us to reach an audience in a new and better way. With the click of a link on social media, end users can now access engaging, high quality interactive 3D experiences. They no longer have to visit an app store for these types of applications. And we, as app/game developers, need to be thinking about how we can best exploit these technologies. So I showed lots of examples of applications covering games, e-commerce, guerrilla marketing, and so on. Hopefully, I convinced a few people in the audience to dive in and discover the power and versatility of HTML5 and WebGL!\\n\\nAfter the talk, I took part in a panel, with a remit to consider the future of video game development.\\n\\n[![Buzz Workshop Panel](/img/buzz-workshop-panel.png)](/img/buzz-workshop-panel.png)\\n\\nAs you can imagine, this was my specialist subject and it was good to chat with some great co-panelists about where things are heading. As I see it, it\'s all about community, collaboration and accessibility - and PlayCanvas nails all of those, and then some.\\n\\nAnd with that, I\'ll end with this piece of advice: go download the XDK today and have a play with it. Intel have built something wondrous so don\'t miss out!"},{"id":"playcanvas-maintenance-1102014","metadata":{"permalink":"/playcanvas-maintenance-1102014","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2014-10-01-playcanvas-maintenance-1102014.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-10-01-playcanvas-maintenance-1102014.md","title":"PlayCanvas Maintenance 1/10/2014","description":"We\'re going to be performing server maintenance over the next 48 hours to prepare for the next stages of our growth.","date":"2014-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"maintenance","permalink":"/tags/maintenance"}],"readingTime":0.585,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","published":false,"slug":"playcanvas-maintenance-1102014","title":"PlayCanvas Maintenance 1/10/2014","tags":["maintenance"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Intel gives HTML5 some love at the Buzz Workshop","permalink":"/intel-gives-html5-some-love-at-the-buzz-workshop"},"nextItem":{"title":"PlayCanvas Update 21/9/2014","permalink":"/playcanvas-update-2192014"}},"content":"We\'re going to be performing server maintenance over the next 48 hours to prepare for the next stages of our growth.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWhilst we hope you won\'t be affected.

Take a look at our [announcement post](https://blog.playcanvas.com/new-plans/).\\n\\n### Improvements\\n\\n#### Synchronous Components and Cloning\\n\\nThis has been on the horizon a little while. With this new update to the engine, adding components to an entity and cloning it into new entity are now synchronous. Making your code much simpler:\\n\\n```javascript\\n  var e = this.entity.clone();\\n  // e is ready to use\\n```\\n\\nPreviously in this code, the clone method took at least one frame to execute. This is a big improvement when you are creating Entities\xa0on the fly.\\n\\n#### Publish over existing applications\\n\\nAnother little improvement that\'ll save you time.\xa0If you\xa0publish an application with the same name as an existing application you\'ll be prompted to overwrite the older app.\\n\\n### Application view counts\\n\\nThis is just the start of something big, but we now display how many people have viewed your published game on the application page.

Then I didn\'t do anything for a few years and got back into it at my last year at Oxford University where me and a friend wrote a game about a skateboarding monkey called Stunt Monkey.\\n\\nWhen it came to applying for jobs after university I fell into game development as it was the first job I applied for. I worked at Rebellion in Oxford for a couple of years on Gameboy Advance and PlayStation 2 titles. Then I moved to London where I worked for Sony for about 7 years. During this time I made the change from AI/gameplay programmer to Tools programmer.\\n\\n**Can you briefly describe your role at PlayCanvas?**\\n\\nI\'m the CTO, which is a grand title for a small team.

If there is one thing you can be certain of, it\'s that every device released in the future, from phone, to TV, to something we haven\'t thought of yet, will have have a web browser.

So I studied Computer Science at the University of Piraeus where I researched everything I could about graphics and game development and then I got an MSE in Computer Science from the University Of Pennsylvania. I was very fortunate to get a job as a Junior Programmer at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, where I met Dave and Will and I\'ve been working on games and game related tools ever since!\\n\\n**Can you briefly describe your role at PlayCanvas?**\\n\\nMy work at PlayCanvas includes implementing and documenting new features for the Engine, the Designer and the backend, improving user workflows, fixing bugs and creating game demos whenever I can. We\'re a small team so we all contribute our ideas of what we should be working on based on our experience working on other engines and games.\\n\\n**What is your favorite aspect of PlayCanvas\' service?**\\n\\nThe fact that I can work on my game anywhere from any device. I\'m not limited by the operating system and I don\'t have to worry about source control or where to store all my assets. Everything is on the cloud and I can instantly share my work with others or invite them to my project to work with me, without going through the whole process of downloading and installing tools first.\\n\\n**Where do you see web based gaming in the future?**\\n\\nI think game development is moving towards people working together from all around the world. This used to be a big barrier before - for example, as a programmer with not a lot of artistic talent, I was limited to downloading free models and textures from the Internet. If I wanted to make something unique and pretty I had to find an artist. Then I would have to give that artist access to some repository and explain to them how the whole source control thing works. The artist would have to compile and run the game in their machine or I would have to be there physically to do it for them. You can see where this is going... With PlayCanvas you simply don\'t think about that stuff anymore. PlayCanvas empowers people from all around the world to work with whomever they want, instantly.\\n\\n**How is PlayCanvas going to change the way people make games?**\\n\\nOne of the main reasons why developers would want to develop games that work in the browser is the fact that their game would be more accessible by everybody. One of the reasons why people avoided making games for the Web was that they were limited to simplistic games that may not have appealed to their taste. I believe that WebGL and game-related web technologies in general have become more and more reliable in every device and as tools get better developers will be empowered to make any kind of game they want. I think that eventually most games will be playable in the browser so PlayCanvas is moving in the right direction.\\n\\n**Can you describe one interesting thing about yourself?**\\n\\nI used to play basketball during the period between elementary school and university and before all this I considered doing it for a living. I even played in the major leagues for a while!

Either right-click in the 3D view and select the camera you want from there, or alternatively do it from this new combo box (below). You can also move the selected camera wherever you want using the normal camera controls in the Designer.\\n\\n[![Camera Select](/img/designer-camera-select.jpg)](/img/designer-camera-select.jpg)\\n\\n### Entity Context Menu\\n\\nWe added a new Entity context menu that appears when you right-click on an Entity in the 3D view. From there you can see all the parent Entities of the selected Entity up to the root and you can select a parent Entity easily. You can also see more options for Entities like Delete, Add Component, etc.\\n\\n[![Entity context](/img/designer-entity-context-menu.jpg)](/img/designer-entity-context-menu.jpg)\\n\\n### Error Console\\n\\nWhenever you try to launch a game from the Designer you will see errors in a new console, so you no longer need to wonder why the game is not loading.\xa0You can click on the problematic script and get transferred to the code editor at the offending line.\\n\\n[![error console](/img/error-console.jpg)](/img/error-console.jpg)\\n\\n### Shadow Distance\\n\\nWe added Shadow Distance in the Scene Settings, a value that controls that maximum distance from the camera from which shadows coming from Directional Lights are visible. Just toggle your scene settings to adjust it. This makes shadows from Directional Lights visible in the Designer as they no longer rely on the frustum of the camera.\\n\\n### Events & Oculus Rift Support\\n\\nWe also showed our faces at a number of events this week.

Where extreme latency and narrow fields of vision have prevented previous Virtual Reality technologies from being immersive, they have often proved successful in creating nausea. As humans are sensitive to latencies as low as 20 milliseconds it is important for the technology in question to be as precise and fast as possible.\\n\\nUsually leaving users craning necks and grabbing thin air in disbelief, the Oculus takes over 1000 readings per second and so far is effective enough to trick the mind and simulate a physical presence. The VR industry is now closer to \'telexistance\' than ever before. Mark Zuckerberg, the current owner of the technology (following an\xa0acquisition worth $2 billion by Facebook) described its potential, exclaiming \xa0\\"Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world, or consulting with a doctor face-to-face\u2014just by putting on goggles in your home.\u201d. The Oculus promises that in (hopefully few) years to come, gamers may be able to act and react naturally in what is still a virtual setting.\\n\\n## The Oculus Rift and\xa0PlayCanvas\\n\\n[![Dave in VR](/img/dave-vr.jpg)](/img/dave-vr.jpg)  \\n_Oculus Rift support coming soon to PlayCanvas_\\n\\nImagine a future where you open your Internet browser, select a VR ready online game, enable your Oculus headset and transport yourself into the game immediately. Mind blowing? Potentially yes.\xa0This is why we here at PlayCanvas are committed to intertwining the paths of both WebGL and HTML5 technologies with the capabilities of the Oculus Rift. It\'s crazy to think that VR games could be played and developed by simply opening your favorite web browser.\\n\\nFirefox are already thinking about VR on the web. Chrome are too. Be sure that when VR support fully comes to the web, PlayCanvas will be ready to help you get there faster. Game Developer\'s have so many challenges to overcome while developing their game that adding VR (or Head-Mounted Display) support\xa0could become just another one of the\xa0features that you\'d love to try but never quite have time to do.\xa0However, using PlayCanvas it\'s simple. Just drop the OculusCamera script onto your camera and we\'ll do all the magic to make your game render ready for the headset.\\n\\nHyper-realistic gaming experiences should not be limited to core gaming platforms. When web-based gaming can involve products like the Oculus we\'re opening up an whole new class of\xa0immersive gaming experiences. The best of the features of the web; low-friction, accessible and shareable; with the best features of the Oculus, immersive, high-end experiences. It\'s brave new world!\\n\\n**Dave Evans (CTO at PlayCanvas) will be showcasing some of our work with the Oculus Rift on [June 19th\xa0at the Scenario Bar](https://www.meetup.com/London-Indie-Game-Developers/events/185608412/).** **Check out the Event link\xa0[here](https://www.meetup.com/London-Indie-Game-Developers/events/185608412/)\xa0and\xa0maybe we will see you there!**"},{"id":"meet-the-playcanvas-team-will-eastcott","metadata":{"permalink":"/meet-the-playcanvas-team-will-eastcott","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2014-06-18-meet-the-playcanvas-team-will-eastcott.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-06-18-meet-the-playcanvas-team-will-eastcott.md","title":"Meet the PlayCanvas team: Will Eastcott","description":"Our recent commitment to open sourcing is not the only thing we at PlayCanvas are open about.

During my time at Imperial College in London where I studied Computing, I had to do a 6 month industrial placement. I joined a VR company that\'s still around today in the form of\xa0[Virtalis](https://www.virtalis.com/). But being the late 90s, the technology was underwhelming and I wanted to be back near to London, so I took an interview at Criterion Software where I started out as an engineer developing RenderWare. If you haven\'t heard of RenderWare before, it powered hundreds of PS2 titles (including the GTA series). I think it\'s fair to say, I learned a lot working with such awesome teams.\\n\\n**Can you briefly describe your role at PlayCanvas?**\\n\\nI\'m CEO. I\'m a technical guy, so although I don\'t do much coding myself these days, I know enough to keep the coding team on their toes. I spend most of my time dealing with the mechanics of running the business and promoting what we\'re doing out to the wider world. If I had to pick one thing I do and do best, it\'s predicting where we need to be 5 years from now and figuring out how we get there. So far, so good!\\n\\n**What is your favorite aspect of PlayCanvas\' service?**\\n\\nTough question, there\'s a lot to choose from. For me, it\'s the collaborative nature of the tools. It was the killer feature of Google Docs that completely blew me away. We\'re doing the same thing for game developers. It really is a revelation once you\'ve experienced it.\\n\\n**How is PlayCanvas changing the way people make games?**\\n\\nIt\'s becoming more transparent. If you choose to work in public, I can see your project at any time I want to. I can play your games any time, anywhere and on any device. We\'re making the process more collaborative, with a multi-user editor where you can see the game come together live before your eyes. And we\'re opening game development up to a far wider audience, by making the tools incredibly accessible. Did I mention we\'re open source now?\\n\\n**Where do you see web based gaming in the future?**\\n\\nI see it becoming the pinnacle in convenience. Ultimate accessibility. Completely cross-platform. And even more dynamic and open than it is today.\\n\\n**Can you describe one interesting thing about yourself?**\\n\\nI wanted to work at Marvel Comics when I was 18. I used to take my portfolio along to the London Comic Art Convention looking for a job. In the end, my coding skills won out which is probably for the best!\\n\\n#### The Quick-fire Round (this is where things get a little interesting)\\n\\n**Zelda or Final fantasy?**\\n\\nZelda\\n\\n**COD or Battlefield?**\\n\\nCOD\\n\\n**Mario or Sonic?**\\n\\nMario\\n\\n**Favorite game of all time?**\\n\\nNo contest: Elite.\\n\\n**Greatest Gaming achievement?**\\n\\nCan losing be an achievement?

Which means you can download it, fork it, and generally use it for anything you like.\\n\\n### Why open source, why now?\\n\\nEver since we started the engine\xa0open source was always on our mind. We\'ve never hidden the source code from developers. Minified versions are\xa0available for performance reasons, but\xa0during development users always have had full access to the\xa0un-mangled engine. This is critical for debugging and\xa0fulfilling our\xa0mantra to _make game development easier_.\\n\\nIn reality the engine has been open source since the get go. Officially open sourcing the project was just a matter of time, and the time is now.\xa0The engine is mature enough that\xa0we\'ve established the basic structure, style and functionality but contributors will still be able\xa0to make a meaningful contributions to the engine. And of course we\'ve\xa0now found the time to lay down the foundations of the [developer documentation](https://developer.playcanvas.com),\xa0the [API reference](https://api.playcanvas.com), the [samples](https://playcanvas.github.io)\xa0and all the other stuff that makes game development a joy not a chore.\\n\\nFor developers who\xa0just want to hack on the code with the overhead of the\xa0tools this news is great. Simply download the engine, open up your text editor and get cracking. For\xa0those of you who want more structure, and higher level tools, the [PlayCanvas platform](https://playcanvas.com) is a perfect addition to accelerate your game production.\\n\\n### So, this engine? What is it?\\n\\nIn case you haven\'t come across the PlayCanvas Engine before, it\'s\xa0a JavaScript library engineered specifically for building video games. It implements all of the major components that you need to write high quality games:\\n\\n- **Graphics:** model loading, per-pixel lighting, shadow mapping, post effects\\n- **Physics:** rigid body simulation, ray casting, joints, trigger volumes, vehicles\\n- **Animation:** keyframing, skeletal blending, skinning\\n- **Audio engine:** 2D and 3D audio sources\\n- **Input devices:** mouse, keyboard, touch and gamepad support\\n- **Entity-component system:** high level game object management\\n\\n### Design Goals\\n\\nWe had a couple of goals in mind when we originally designed the engine.\\n\\n1. It had to be easy to work with.\\n\\n2. It had to be blazingly fast.\\n\\n#### Simple Yet Powerful\\n\\nAs a developer, you want well documented and well architected APIs. But you also want to be able to understand what\u2019s going on under the hood and to debug when things go wrong. For this, there\u2019s no substitute for a carefully hand-crafted, unminified, open source codebase.\\n\\nAdditionally, you need great graphics, physics and audio engines. But the PlayCanvas Engine takes things a step further. It exposes a game framework that implements an **entity-component system**, allowing you to build the objects in your games as if they were made of Lego-like blocks of functionality. So what does this look like? Let\u2019s check out a simple example on CodePen\\n\\n[![playcanvas_codepen](/img/playcanvas_codepen.jpg)](http://codepen.io/playcanvas/pen/ctxoD)\\n\\nAs you can see from the Pen\u2019s JS panel, in just over 100 lines of code, you can create, light, simulate and view interesting 3D scenes. Try forking the CodePen and change some values for yourself.\\n\\n#### Need For Speed\\n\\nTo ensure we get great performance, we\u2019ve built PlayCanvas as a hybrid of hand-written JavaScript and machine generated [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/). The most performance critical portion of the codebase is the physics engine. This is implemented as a thin, hand-written layer that wraps [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/), the Emscripten-generated JavaScript port of the open source physics engine Bullet. If you haven\u2019t heard of Bullet before, it powers amazing AAA games like Red Dead Redemption and GTAV. So all of this power is also exposed via the PlayCanvas engine. Ammo.js executes at approximately 1.5x native code speed in recent builds of Firefox so if you think that complex physics simulation is just not practical with JavaScript, think again.\\n\\nBut what about the non-asm.js parts of the codebase? Performance is clearly still super-important, especially for the graphics engine. The renderer is highly optimized to sort draw calls by material and eliminate redundant WebGL calls. It has also been carefully written to avoid making dynamic allocations to head off potential stalls due to garbage collection. So the code performs brilliantly but is also lightweight and human readable.\\n\\n### Powering Awesome Projects\\n\\n[![Editor](/img/editor-swooop.jpg)](/img/editor-swooop.jpg)\\n\\nThe PlayCanvas Engine is already powering some great projects. By far and away, the biggest is the [PlayCanvas web site](https://playcanvas.com): the world\u2019s first cloud-hosted game development platform.\\n\\nFor years, we\u2019ve been frustrated with the limitations of current generation game engines. So shortly after starting work on the PlayCanvas Engine, we began designing a new breed of game development environment that would be:\\n\\n- **Accessible** -\xa0Using any device with a web browser, plug in a URL and instantly access simple, intuitive yet powerful tools.\\n- **Collaborative** -\xa0See what you teammates are working on in real-time or just sit back and watch a game as it\u2019s built live before your eyes.\\n- **Social** -\xa0Making games is easier with the help of others. Be part of an online community of developers like you.\\n\\nPlayCanvas ticks all of these boxes beautifully. But don\u2019t take our word for it \u2013 [try it for yourself](https://playcanvas.com)\xa0and discover a better way to make games.\\n\\n### Speaking of Games\\n\\nIt\'s all very well talking about engines and tools, but engines are only as good as the games they let you make. Fortunately we\'ve got a doozy for you.\\n\\n[![SWOOOP](/img/swooop_blog.jpg)](http://swooop.playcanvas.com/)  \\n_SWOOOP - mobile browser game built using the PlayCanvas Engine_\\n\\n[SWOOOP](http://swooop.playcanvas.com) is a\xa0great demonstration of what you can achieve with HTML5 and WebGL today. The game runs great in both mobile and desktop browsers and PlayCanvas also supports\xa0publishing to App Stores through third-party tools like [Ludei\'s CocoonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CocoonJS) or the open source [Ejecta](https://impactjs.com/ejecta) project.\\n\\n### Get Involved\\n\\nSo you want to help us make the very best 3D\xa0engine on the web?

Apple has just published the session schedule for WWDC 2014. If you scan the session list, you will find this:\\n\\n[![WWDC WebGL Session](/img/wwdc-webgl-session.png)](/img/wwdc-webgl-session.png)\\n\\nSo what can we deduce from this (and do excuse the speculation):\\n\\n1. Apple would not be running a session on WebGL if it was not supported on its browser platform. Therefore, an update to Safari with WebGL \'on by default\' must be imminent.\\n\\n2. The bigger question is whether Mobile Safari will also support WebGL. The WWDC app actually has a filter so that you can display sessions relevant to iOS, OS X or both. If you just select iOS, Apple\'s WebGL session is still displayed. Interesting, I think you will agree. I would also suggest that Apple would not want to enable a feature or API on desktop and not support it on mobile (and vice versa). It is more likely that Apple has delayed enabling WebGL by default on desktop until they considered it ready for general release on mobile.\\n\\nSo, it seems that the final domino is teetering, about to fall. WebGL on Safari is coming. Happy days.\\n\\n### Update\\n\\nSafari 7.1 should have WebGL enabled by default.

And when it\'s a game you have created yourself, it\'s a very personal and powerful gift.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nSo I took part in Ludum Dare once more on the 26th-27th of April. Before I even knew the theme, I developed a number of aims:\\n\\n- I was going to be using PlayCanvas and I was going to be pushing the tools as hard as I possibly could.\\n- I was going to be building my game more transparently than any other game jammer in history. Seriously.\\n- I wanted to make something 3D and physics based.\\n\\nAs usual, the theme was announced in the early hours of Saturday morning: \'Beneath The Surface\'. Ordinarily, I would settle on an obscure interpretation of a theme, but this time around, my creative juices were not in full flow so I took the literal route. I was going to make a game where you would pilot a submarine.\\n\\nAfter about 30 minutes, I had the basic physics of a twin propeller sub implemented (arrow keys to control):\\n\\n[https://playcanv.as/b/iwysiIRg](https://playcanv.as/b/iwysiIRg)\\n\\nI was off to a flying start! But making video games is art. It\'s practically a spectator sport and I was determined to give the internet full access to my creative process. And this is what makes PlayCanvas so cool. I could simply invite the internet into my project:\\n\\n![Pipe Wars Tweet](/img/pipe-wars-tweet.png)\\n\\nAnd indeed, I had a steady flow of curious spectators dropping in and out of [my project](https://playcanvas.com/project/5993/overview/pipe-wars) as it slowly took shape. If nothing else, it kept me super-motivated.\\n\\nThe Twitter comms continued throughout the weekend. In all, I published 10 interim builds of the game plus the final \'gold\' release at submission time. You can find them all in the Publishing Dialog in the Editor. So it\'s great to show the world your game rising from its foundations, but are there any other benefits to this \'bare all\' strategy? Why yes! You get feedback on your game design, you graphical design, your audio, everything! Your Twitter followers are your QA team. Use them!\\n\\nSo I was absolutely nailing the comms side of things. But there was the little matter of actually making the game. I had my simple prototype and now I had to build it out. I slowly developed the concept where the player has to explore an undersea environment to locate and salvage 10 pipes and return them to a \'drop off\' point. I also added the necessity to keep the sub topped up with fuel by visiting refuelling points. There were a number of challenges that I had to solve. I\'ll go through the main ones now:\\n\\n### Terrain\\n\\nI needed a dramatic undersea landscape. Unfortunately, my modelling skills suck so I resorted to a sneaky procedural solution. Step 1: Generate a heightmap. Check out [this tutorial](https://jasonsturges.medium.com/creating-a-terrain-for-unity-3d-with-photoshop-237dd55bba88) that shows you how to do that in Photoshop. Step 2: Create a 150x150 division plane in 3DS Max and apply a Displace modifier. Then set the heightmap as the source texture for the displacement:\\n\\n![Pipe Wars Terrain](/img/pipe-wars-terrain.png)\\n\\nI also exported a 75x75 division version which I would use for environment collision which would essentially be an optimization for the physics engine. It would have been nice if I had had time to texture map it. In Ludum Dare, you have to avoid getting caught up in the detail. Keep your eye on the goal and if you have time left at the end, come back and polish.\\n\\n### Building the Submarine\\n\\nAs I mentioned, my modelling skills are pretty horrendous. Perhaps the hardest thing I had to build was the submarine (I also made a Flappy Bird-esque pipe, a refuelling station and a drop off point). So between 2AM and 5AM on Sunday morning, I built this in 3DS Max:\\n\\n![Pipe Wars Submarine](/img/pipe-wars-submarine.png)\\n\\nSo it wasn\'t pro-level art production, but I was proud that I had improved my skills in this area. I built the propeller separately since they were controlled independently in PlayCanvas. Anyway, I had a lot of fun learning all about powerful 3DS Max features like boolean geometry (for combining meshes in different ways) and various modifiers for skewing and warping meshes.\\n\\n### Game UI\\n\\nHUDs can be a nightmare to build and build fast. Luckily, there\'s a handy PlayCanvas extension that renders bitmap fonts beautifully. It was developed originally for the game [SWOOOP](http://swooop.playcanvas.com/) and it worked so well, it was [open sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/fonts). I found an open source approximation of the Flappy Bird font and imported it into my project. Super easy and it looked great:\\n\\n![Pipe Wars Intro](/img/pipe-wars-intro.jpg)\\n\\n### Audio\\n\\nI\'ve already mentioned that I can\'t model for toffee. My composing skills are even worse. So what\'s a Ludum Darer to do? I googled: \'Ludum Dare procedural music\'. Top link:\\n\\n[https://pernyblom.github.io/abundant-music/index.html](https://pernyblom.github.io/abundant-music/index.html)\\n\\nThe Abundant Music procedural music generator is great:\\n\\n[![Music Generator](/img/abundant-music.png)](/img/abundant-music.png)\\n\\nCheck it out for yourself!\\n\\nHopefully, that gives you a good idea of how I spent a lot of my time while developing the game. Do check out the project for yourselves to learn more and, hey, if you want to see the finished game:\\n\\n[**PLAY NOW!!**](https://playcanv.as/p/7wWIHILP/)\\n\\nSo I guess the moral of the story here is that you don\'t need to be a Leonardo de Vinci to make artwork or Mozart to make game audio. There are tools out there that can do 90% of the heavy lifting. You just need to know which buttons to press. Doing your research in advance of a game jam will help you. And the more jams you do, the more tricks you will have up your sleeve.\\n\\nI\'ve been making video games for decades now and I\'m still learning. I guess that\'s what keep me coming back for more.

Monetization on the web is harder than it is on mobile app stores, where payment processing is standardized and credit card details are stored. But there are still a number of options. One great platform you should consider for your game is the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIt\'s a carefully curated app store for the desktop version of Chrome (available on Win, Mac, Linux and Chrome OS). Publishing your game here will expose it to a wider audience and offer you a simple mechanism for taking payments. In this article, I won\'t cover the options for charging money for your game (a story for another day). Instead, let\'s step through the process for publishing a free game.\\n\\nSo what are the options? Google lets you publish your game as a hosted app or a packaged app.\\n\\n### Hosted Apps\\n\\nHosted apps are essentially vanilla websites with a little extra metadata. Why are hosted apps good?\\n\\n- Your game will be discoverable by Chrome Web Store users.\\n- Chrome Web Store users can install your hosted app to their Apps page in Chrome which is really just a beefed up bookmark for your game. This will be synched across the different devices on which you use Chrome (if you\'re signed in).\\n\\nSo this sounds great. More people will be installing and playing your game. PlayCanvas has published a hosted app; a game called Dungeon Fury.\\n\\n[![Dungeon Fury](/img/dungeon-fury-promo.png)](/img/dungeon-fury-promo.png)\\n\\nCheck it out on the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dungeon-fury/mnokkobfbdgpnlinolfpemmaloeljfle).\\n\\nTo get started, hit the cog icon at the top right of the landing page for the Chrome Web Store and select Developer Dashboard. Sign in and click the button labelled \'Add New Item\'.\\n\\nHere\'s a little checklist of things that you\'ll need to publish a hosted app:\\n\\n- A zip file containing a manifest and a 128x128 icon for your game. Google supplies a [reference for the manifest file format](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest) and\xa0[guidelines for creating icons](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/images) (and other images related to your submission).\\n- A description for your game. Make it fun and exciting! Remember, you\'re trying to persuade somebody to install your game so make it sound amazing.\\n- A number of screenshots and YouTube links to give potential users an idea of what your game is like to play.\\n- A number of images that Google can use to promote your game in the Web Store. Depending on how successful your game becomes, it may be displayed in a small, medium or large (marquee) tile. Spend time ensuring that you provide all of these images. A great game can be let down by uninspiring promotional images!\\n- Verification that you own the URL of your hosted app. You should do this using [Google\'s WebMaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en).\\n\\nThere are a few other options that cover Google Analytics, game category, regions where your game will be listed and so on. When you\'re done, hit \'Publish\'. Note that Google spends a little time (no longer than 60 minutes but should be much faster) to scan your upload before it is made live in the store.\\n\\n### Packaged Apps\\n\\nSo hosted apps are great, but they have some problems:\\n\\n- Users may think you\'ve been lazy! \'Hey! This is just a link to their web-site! Grrr!\'. Users expect a little more from something that is being installed to their browser.\\n- Hosted apps won\'t run offline (unless you make clever use of the browser\'s local storage).\\n- Hosted apps are just web pages and don\'t feel like applications.\\n- If your game consists of a large quantity of data and doesn\'t do any caching, load times can be long.\\n\\nEnter packaged apps! These are essentially apps that are fully installed to Chrome, can run offline and launch in there own window minus Chrome\'s browser decoration (although this can be added if you wish). And because they\'re loaded from local storage, they start up extremely quickly.\\n\\nPlayCanvas has also published an example of a packaged app in the Chrome Web Store. It\'s a game called SWOOOP:\\n\\n![SWOOOP](/img/swooop-tile.png)\\n\\nCheck it out for yourself [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/swooop/jblimahfbhdcengjfbdpdngcfcghladf).\\n\\nGenerating a packaged app from a PlayCanvas game takes a little more effort than a hosted app. Here\'s a run down of the steps required to package and publish a game like SWOOOP:\\n\\n- Download the most recently exported version of the game from the Exports tab of the\xa0Project Dashboard.\\n- Unzip the contents.\\n- In the index.html, there are two externally referenced resources: the PlayCanvas engine (playcanvas-0.144.3.min.js and\xa0PLAY_FLAT_ORANGE3.png). Download these resources and change the paths so they are relative to the index.html file.\\n- Create a manifest.json file . For SWOOOP, it looks like this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"name\\": \\"SWOOOP\\",\\n  \\"description\\": \\"Loop and swoop your bi-plane around the magical island. What\'s your highscore?\\",\\n  \\"version\\": \\"1.0\\",\\n  \\"app\\": {\\n    \\"background\\": {\\n      \\"scripts\\": [\\"background.js\\"]\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \\"icons\\": {\\n    \\"16\\": \\"swooop16.png\\",\\n    \\"48\\": \\"swooop48.png\\",\\n    \\"128\\": \\"swooop128.png\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- Create background.js that contains the following to configure how the game is launched:\\n\\n```javascript\\n  chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched.addListener(function() {\\n    chrome.app.window.create(\'index.html\', {\\n      \'bounds\': {\\n        \'width\': 1280,\\n        \'height\': 720\\n      }\\n    });\\n  });\\n```\\n\\n- Create the icons referenced from the manifest and place them in the same folder as the index.html.\\n- Transfer any script tag blocks of JavaScript in index.html into externally referenced JS files (there are two). This is because Chrome treats this as a security threat.\\n- Remove the following statement (which causes another security error in Chrome) from playcanvas-0.144.3.min.js (search for \'unload\'):\\n\\n```javascript\\n  window.addEventListener(\\"unload\\", function() {\\n    o.disconnect();\\n    o = null\\n  });\\n```\\n\\n- Check to see if your game uses the LocalStorage HTML5 API. Packaged apps can\'t use this API,\xa0although they can use a [Chrome specific alternative](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/apps/manifest/storage/).\\n- We\'re done! Zip up the game\'s files again and upload to your new item in the CWS Developer Dashboard. Fill out the rest of the form as you would for a hosted app (although you now don\'t need to show ownership for a hosted app URL since there isn\'t one any more).\\n\\nSo hopefully this gives some insight into how simple it is to publish your game to the Chrome Web Store. Whether you choose to publish a hosted or packaged app is up to you and, as we\'ve shown, both have their advantages and disadvantages. My recommendation to you is to experiment. It\'s an awesome publishing platform that anyone can start to use today, so try it out for yourself!"},{"id":"swooop","metadata":{"permalink":"/swooop","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2014-03-21-swooop.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-03-21-swooop.md","title":"SWOOOP","description":"SWOOOP title","date":"2014-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"game","permalink":"/tags/game"},{"inline":true,"label":"swooop","permalink":"/tags/swooop"}],"readingTime":1.705,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","slug":"swooop","title":"SWOOOP","tags":["game","swooop"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Publishing HTML5 Games on the Chrome Web Store","permalink":"/publishing-html5-games-on-the-chrome-web-store"},"nextItem":{"title":"PlayCanvas @ SXSW","permalink":"/playcanvas-sxsw"}},"content":"[![SWOOOP title](/img/swooop_blog.jpg)](/img/swooop_blog.jpg)  \\n_SWOOOP - mobile browser game built using the PlayCanvas Engine_\\n\\nToday, PlayCanvas is excited to reveal [SWOOOP](http://swooop.playcanvas.com).

It was made by just 2 developers, a single programmer and a single artist, located in different cities (Athens and London). This sort of remote development is only possible using our cloud-hosted toolset. It\'s a game-changing technology for developers who\'ve never had this feature before.\\n\\nTry SWOOOP for yourselves at [http://swooop.playcanvas.com/](http://swooop.playcanvas.com/) it runs great in all modern browsers.

SWOOOP is the world\'s best looking game, available to play in mobile browsers.\\n\\n### Mobile App Stores\\n\\nWhile SWOOOP runs great in browsers, both desktop and mobile, it\'s important that we allow game creators the widest possible distribution. Which is why we\'ve partnered with Ludei. Using their [CocoonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CocoonJS) technology we\'re able to compile SWOOOP to a native application that can run on both Android and iOS devices.

It\'s a rare event that we introduce breaking changes and we only do it because we\'re certain it\'s going to help you be much more productive. So what have we changed?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nPreviously, we had a Math API which consisted of static functions that operated on arrays (JavaScript typed arrays, to be specific). It was fast - very fast - but this came at the expense of a developer-friendly interface. Therefore, we have written a brand new Math API that is object-oriented and far crisper to write against. Here\'s an example of how things were:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Generate a vector from a to b rescaled to be 10 units long\\nvar a = pc.math.vec3.create(1, 2, 3);\\nvar b = pc.math.vec3.create(4, 5, 6);\\nvar result = pc.math.vec3.create();\\npc.math.vec3.sub(b, a, result);\\npc.math.vec3.normalize(result, result);\\npc.math.vec3.scale(result, 10, result);\\n```\\n\\nA bit verbose! Here\'s how things look now:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// Generate a vector from a to b rescaled to be 10 units long\\nvar a = new pc.Vec3(1, 2, 3);\\nvar b = new pc.Vec3(4, 5, 6);\\nvar result = new pc.Vec3();\\nresult.sub2(b, a).normalize().scale(10);\\n```\\n\\nMuch better! As you can see, you can now chain math functions together to apply lots of operations in order.\\n\\nSo what if you\'ve already written PlayCanvas script code against the old API? How do you upgrade it? Here\'s a brief guide.\\n\\n### Accessing Math Object Elements\\n\\nThe old way:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar x = vector[0];\\nvar y = vector[1];\\nvar z = vector[2];\\n```\\n\\nThe new way:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar x = vector.x;\\nvar y = vector.y;\\nvar z = vector.z;\\n```\\n\\n### Creating Math Objects\\n\\nThe old way:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar v2 = pc.math.vec2.create(1, 2);\\nvar v3 = pc.math.vec3.create(1, 2, 3);\\nvar v4 = pc.math.vec4.create(1, 2, 3, 4);\\nvar m4 = pc.math.mat4.create();\\nvar q1 = pc.math.quat.create(0, 0, 0, 1);\\n```\\n\\nThe new way:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar v2 = new pc.Vec2(1, 2);\\nvar v3 = new pc.Vec3(1, 2, 3);\\nvar v4 = new pc.Vec4(1, 2, 3, 4);\\nvar m4 = new pc.Mat4();\\nvar q1 = new pc.Quat(0, 0, 0, 1);\\n```\\n\\n### Math Object Constants\\n\\nThe old way:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar zeroVec = pc.math.vec3.zero;\\n```\\n\\nThe new way:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar zeroVec = pc.Vec3.ZERO;\\n```\\n\\n### API Reference Pages\\n\\nWe strongly urge you to check out the API reference pages for the new API. We\'ve worked hard to ensure every function has been lovingly documented (including sample code). If you spot any mistakes, have feedback or need any help whatsoever, [do let us know](https://forum.playcanvas.com)!\\n\\nReference pages can be found here:\\n\\n- [`pc.Vec2`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Vec2.html) - A 2-dimensional vector\\n- [`pc.Vec3`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Vec3.html) - A 3-dimensional vector\\n- [`pc.Vec4`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Vec4.html) - A 4-dimensional vector\\n- [`pc.Mat4`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Mat4.html) - A 4x4 matrix\\n- [`pc.Quat`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Quat.html) - A quaternion\\n\\n### Unrelated Changes\\n\\nSince we have made such sweeping API changes, we have also taken the opportunity to remove some deprecated functions. The following are no longer in the engine:\\n\\n- `pc.fw.RigidBodyComponent#get/setLinearVelocity` - use [`linearVelocity`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/RigidBodyComponent.html#linearvelocity) property\\n- `pc.fw.RigidBodyComponent#get/setAngularVelocity` - use [`angularVelocity`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/RigidBodyComponent.html#angularvelocity) property\\n- `pc.fw.RigidBodyComponent#get/setLinearFactor` - use [`linearFactor`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/RigidBodyComponent.html#linearfactor) property\\n- `pc.fw.RigidBodyComponent#get/setAngularFactor` - use [`angularFactor`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/RigidBodyComponent.html#angularfactor) property\\n- `pc.scene.Scene#get/setGlobalAmbient` - use [`ambientLight`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Scene.html#ambientlight) property\\n\\nWe hope you like the new interface!"},{"id":"new-maths-api","metadata":{"permalink":"/new-maths-api","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2014-01-13-new-maths-api.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-01-13-new-maths-api.md","title":"Incoming Breaking Changes - New Maths API","description":"Our new math API will make your life so much easier, but it will require updating your game.","date":"2014-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"engine","permalink":"/tags/engine"}],"readingTime":2.27,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","slug":"new-maths-api","title":"Incoming Breaking Changes - New Maths API","tags":["engine"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"New Math API: A Transition Guide","permalink":"/new-math-api-a-transition-guide"},"nextItem":{"title":"Primitives are Dead!

A critically important base for your engine and used by almost every game that is written using the engine. The Math library must be fast, consistent and succinct.\\n\\nThe PlayCanvas engine was first started almost 3 years ago, so the Math library is already a venerable old friend. But it\'s a friend that is in need of a facelift. (!? - Ed) So in the next few days we\'ll be releasing Math API v2.0 for our Engine.\\n\\n## What does this mean for you?\\n\\nFirst, let\'s give you a little sample of how the Math library is going to work.\\n\\nHere is some code from our recent Ludum Dare game Going Around.\\n\\n```javascript\\n// In this code, we get the camera position,\\n// We convert a mouse click into world space\\n// Then we calculate the ray end point from\\n// the mouse click using a variety of vector operations\\npc.math.vec3.copy(camera.getPosition(), this.rayStart);\\ncamera.camera.screenToWorld(event.x, event.y, 1, this.rayEnd);\\npc.math.vec3.subtract(this.rayEnd, this.rayStart, this.rayEnd);\\npc.math.vec3.normalize(this.rayEnd,this.rayEnd);\\npc.math.vec3.scale(this.rayEnd, RAY_LENGTH, this.rayEnd);\\npc.math.vec3.add(this.rayStart, this.rayEnd, this.rayEnd);\\n\\ncontext.systems.rigidbody.raycastFirst(this.rayStart, this.rayEnd, this.onRayHit.bind(this));\\n```\\n\\nThis is what this will look like in the new API.\\n\\n```javascript\\nthis.rayStart.copy(camera.getPosition());\\ncamera.camera.screenToWorld(event.x, event.y, 1, this.rayEnd);\\n\\n// subtract, then normalize, then scale by RAY_LENGTH, then add\\nthis.rayEnd.sub(this.rayStart).normalize().scale(RAY_LENGTH).add(this.rayStart);\\n\\ncontext.systems.rigidbody.raycastFirst(this.rayStart, this.rayEnd, this.onRayHit.bind(this));\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see we now support chaining vector operations together. This makes the code more concise, and also more readable. If you read through the line you can see we `subtract`, `normalize`, `scale` and then `add`. All into the same vector.\\n\\nThis shows you how it will work for vectors but these changes apply to all our math primitives such as matrices and quaternions.\\n\\nSo hopefully you can see that the new math library is going to be an all round better beast, but obviously it does mean breaking changes. Even though our engine is pre-1.0, we never issue breaking changes lightly. It\'s a pain for you and it\'s a pain for us. But in this case, it\'s important that such a fundamental piece of the engine is easy to use and \\"just right\\".\\n\\n## When is it going to break?\\n\\nWe doing the final round of testing at the moment, just to make sure everything works perfectly.

Applying textures and materials to primitive shapes in the Designer.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### A Bit of History\\n\\nWhen we created the primitive component, we had simplicity in mind. Create box, set the color. That\'s it. Also, this was another time, when material editing wasn\'t available as part of the PlayCanvas Designer. So we created two components, the model, which allowed you to upload a 3D asset complete with materials and textures; and the primitive, the little brother, which only allowed you to set a color.\\n\\nTo get us going this was great, but pretty soon you all started demanding more from the primitive. First it was a lack of a `setVisible()` method which existed on the model. Then you wanted to set a texture map, but in reality you wanted a full-on material.\\n\\n### Long Live the Model Component\\n\\nOnce we realized we were going to be recreating the primitive component with these new features, we gave it a bit of thought and came to the conclusion that the primitive is just a model component with a special built-in set of models, i.e. \xa0box, sphere, capsule, etc. So, combining the two makes perfect sense. We give you the power and flexibility of the model component, but with the ease and speed of the primitive component.\\n\\n### How it Works\\n\\nHe\'s a quick 4 step guide to create a primitive and applying a material.\\n\\n**1.** Upload some textures. For example these [brick textures](http://opengameart.org/content/urban-texture-pack-from-gametexturescom)\xa0from gametextures.com\\n\\n**2.** Create a New Box. From the Entity menu select \\"New Box\\"\\n\\n**3.** Click on the Box to select it, then click on the Box again to select the material.\\n\\n**4.** Click Create Material, then open up the diffuse and normal panels in the Material Editor and drag the assets from the Asset Explorer into the material slots.\\n\\n[![Primitive Materials](/img/primitive_materials.png)](/img/primitive_materials.png)\\n\\nWe hope you enjoy the new power we\'ve given you today. Just enjoy it responsibly. \ud83d\ude09\\n\\nFor more information on materials see the page in our [documentation](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/assets/materials/)."},{"id":"a-wild-designer-appears","metadata":{"permalink":"/a-wild-designer-appears","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2014-01-09-a-wild-designer-appears.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-01-09-a-wild-designer-appears.md","title":"A wild designer appears!","description":"To kick off 2014 with a bang, we\'re welcoming a brand new member to the PlayCanvas family.","date":"2014-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"team","permalink":"/tags/team"}],"readingTime":0.625,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","slug":"a-wild-designer-appears","title":"A wild designer appears!","tags":["team"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Primitives are Dead!

We taken a long hard look at how we add and use Assets and we\'ve buffed and polished the process, taking off the ragged edges so that your workflow is now super smooth. Plus our big new feature, the PlayCanvas Asset Library. Find out more below\\n\\n[![Use pre-made 3D models in your game](/img/asset_library.jpg)](/img/asset_library.jpg)  \\n_Use pre-made 3D models in your game_\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Uploading to the Designer\\n\\nYou can now drag and drop files from your desktop straight into the Designer. This means you never need to leave the Designer tab. Even better, if you drag an 3D model file (like an FBX) into the 3D view, your model will be uploaded, converted and a new Entity with model component all set up will be created for you. So it\'s super easy to get models into your Pack.\\n\\n## Asset Explorer Polish\\n\\nUp until now the Asset Explorer wasn\'t terribly useful. We hid it away at the bottom of the screen and we didn\'t really tell anyone about it, because there wasn\'t much to it. Now, though, we\'ve given it a complete revamp. We\'ve added one-click filters for listing only the assets you\'re interested in. Plus, now there are texture thumbnails and you can now drag assets from the Explorer into other part app, but more of that next...\\n\\n## Drag and Drop Everywhere\\n\\nYou can now drag Assets from the Asset Explorer and drop them into many different places. The first is simple, if you drop a model asset into the 3D view, you\'ll get a new Model Entity. But also you can drag Assets and drop them into Asset pickers in any of the components that accept assets. This applies to models, animations, audio, etc, but also when you are editing Materials, you can just drop the textures into the slots. Speaking of textures...\\n\\n## Texture Thumbnails\\n\\n[![Texture assets now have thumbnails](/img/asset_explorer.jpg)](/img/asset_explorer.jpg)  \\n_Texture assets now have thumbnails_\\n\\nWe\'ve started working on thumbnails for all Assets, but as a quick starter, textures now display with the proper thumbnail. No more guessing which one is the normal map when you\'re setting up your materials. Thumbnails for more Asset will be done soon.\\n\\n## Asset Library\\n\\n<div className=\\"iframe-container\\">\\n    <iframe loading=\\"lazy\\" width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O7U9IY_nCLM\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\nHave we saved the best feature until last? Maybe. Certainly the Asset Library is going to make it much easier for our new users to get something looking pretty. We\'ve teamed up with lovely folks at\xa0[3dmodels-textures.com](https://3dmodels-textures.com) and [propsplanet.com](https://propsplanet.com) to give you a selection of 3D models which you can use to get started. Click the big red Asset Library button to open up a list of models and one-click to add them to your Project.\\n\\nWe encourage you to check the free assets from the kind folks and then head over to their websites and see all the other awesome stuff they have on offer."},{"id":"who-ludum-dares-wins","metadata":{"permalink":"/who-ludum-dares-wins","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2013-12-09-who-ludum-dares-wins.md","source":"@site/blog/2013-12-09-who-ludum-dares-wins.md","title":"Who Ludum Dares Wins!","description":"Submit a game to Ludum Dare and get a 1 year pro account for free!","date":"2013-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ludum-dare","permalink":"/tags/ludum-dare"}],"readingTime":0.7,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","slug":"who-ludum-dares-wins","title":"Who Ludum Dares Wins!","tags":["ludum-dare"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Friday Assets Mega-update","permalink":"/friday-assets-mega-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Changes for 25th November","permalink":"/changes-for-25th-november"}},"content":"Submit a game to Ludum Dare and get a 1 year pro account for **free**!\\n\\nAt PlayCanvas we love to Jam.

WebGL is rapidly being integrated into browsers and all of a sudden, game developers have the technologies they need to deliver high quality 3D video games without having to deploy a native app. To show what is possible today, PlayCanvas has developed the game \'Dungeon Fury\', a light-hearted fantasy game that pushes your reflexes to the limit. Dungeon Fury represents the world\'s first 3D HTML5 browser game that is built specifically for mobile (although it works great in desktop browsers too!). And if all this wasn\'t cool enough, the whole game was written using only a web browser, made possible with the PlayCanvas game engine!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n[PLAY DUNGEON FURY NOW!](http://dungeonfury.playcanvas.com/)\\n\\nPlayCanvas on mobile is built upon bleeding edge technologies and as such, the game is pushing mobile browsers very hard indeed. Consequently there are some known issues and things to look out for. Supported mobile browsers are as follows:\\n\\n- **Firefox for Android**\\n  - The game works in the Release Channel build but performance is far higher in the [Nightly Channel](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/android/#nightly).\\n- **Chrome for Android**\\n  - WebGL needs to be enabled by toggling \'Enable WebGL\' in chrome://flags.\\n  - Game audio is fairly unreliable and when it does play, it lags the gameplay quite significantly. Google are hard at work, implementing Web Audio for Chrome M27, so this is a temporary problem.\\n- **Opera Mobile for Android**\\n  - Works but performance is far behind Firefox and Chrome.\\n- **BlackBerry 10 browser**\\n- **Firefox OS**\\n  - If you don\'t have a test device, check out Mozilla\'s [Firefox OS Simulator](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/firefox-os-simulator-3-0-released/) that is delivered as a Firefox add-on.\\n\\nSupported desktop browsers are:\\n\\n- Firefox\\n- Chrome\\n- Internet Explorer (the game will request you install Chrome Frame if you do not already have it installed)\\n\\nWe\'ll be regularly updating the game in the coming weeks so give us your feedback. We\'ll also be releasing further blog entries detailing how we built the game.

But, as the community grows, and as you learn more about how PlayCanvas can help you make games, you are encouraged to answer questions yourselves and help other developers make games faster and more easily.\\n\\nSome good PlayCanvas Answers questions:\\n\\n- How do I include an external JavaScript library in my game?\\n- How can I add a HUD to my game?\\n\\n### What isn\'t PlayCanvas Answers?\\n\\nJust like Stack Overflow, PlayCanvas Answers serves a specific need. It is the place you go when you want to find the answer to a question about PlayCanvas. It is not a place to hold a long open-ended discussion.\\n\\nTypes of questions to avoid:\\n\\n- Can PlayCanvas be used to make an MMO?\\n- How do I add two numbers in JavaScript?\\n\\n### Step by Step\\n\\nThis is the first step in the PlayCanvas Community, we have much more to come. It\'ll probably be a little while before Community Part II, but in the meantime, get creating, get asking, and enjoy yourselves.\\n\\n_\\\\* Evil, evil [goto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto#Criticism_and_decline)_"},{"id":"playcanvas-features-in-the-top-10-html5-games-of-2012","metadata":{"permalink":"/playcanvas-features-in-the-top-10-html5-games-of-2012","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2012-12-21-playcanvas-features-in-the-top-10-html5-games-of-2012.md","source":"@site/blog/2012-12-21-playcanvas-features-in-the-top-10-html5-games-of-2012.md","title":"PlayCanvas features in \'The top 10 HTML5 games of 2012\'","description":"D.E.M.O. screenshot","date":"2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"demo","permalink":"/tags/demo"},{"inline":true,"label":"html5","permalink":"/tags/html-5"},{"inline":true,"label":"news","permalink":"/tags/news"}],"readingTime":0.365,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","slug":"playcanvas-features-in-the-top-10-html5-games-of-2012","title":"PlayCanvas features in \'The top 10 HTML5 games of 2012\'","tags":["demo","html5","news"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"PlayCanvas Community Part 1 - Announcing PlayCanvas Answers","permalink":"/announcing-playcanvas-answers"},"nextItem":{"title":"Will HTML5 change the way games are made?","permalink":"/will-html5-change-the-way-games-are-made"}},"content":"[![D.E.M.O. screenshot](/img/scifi-demo.jpg)](https://playcanv.as/p/UAR6UQNM/)\\n\\nGame: D.E.M.O. 3rd Person Shooter\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n[D.E.M.O.](https://playcanv.as/p/UAR6UQNM/) the 3rd-Person action shooter demo that we released back in August has just been featured in .net magazine\'s:\\n\\n### [Top 10 HTML5 games of 2012](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/top-10-html5-games-2012)\\n\\nWe\'re very proud to be up there with some great titles, such as the beautiful [BananaBread](https://kripken.github.io/misc-js-benchmarks/banana/index.html) demo and the super-fun [BrowserQuest](https://browserquest.io/) game from our friends at Mozilla.\\n\\n[![BrowserQuest HTML5 game by Mozilla](/img/browserquest.jpeg)](https://browserquest.io/)\\n\\nBrowserQuest HTML5 game by Mozilla"},{"id":"will-html5-change-the-way-games-are-made","metadata":{"permalink":"/will-html5-change-the-way-games-are-made","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2012-09-10-will-html5-change-the-way-games-are-made.md","source":"@site/blog/2012-09-10-will-html5-change-the-way-games-are-made.md","title":"Will HTML5 change the way games are made?","description":"Oops, we\'ve been so busy that we forgot to mention this article that Will wrote for Game Developer.

There is nothing to install since the web app is delivered to the browser from the server (or the browser\'s cache). The tools always stay seamlessly up to date, which ensures that users remain in sync with each other and are always using the latest and greatest release. User data is always safely backed up and trivially restorable.\\n\\nAnd:\\n\\n> One of the key strengths of HTML5 as a technology for tools is that all content sits on a URL. Each of the resources that make up a game can be accessed at a specific web address: a script file, a texture, a sound, a level or even the game itself. If a new asset is added to a project, the developer can tweet, IM or mail the link immediately.\\n\\nAnd:\\n\\n> Let\'s face it: making games is hard, and making a (good) game alone is not an option for most developers. The spectrum of skills required is often just too great.

Multiplayer 3rd-person shooter running in the browser_\\n\\nPlayCanvas were lucky enough to show a demo of our collaborative HTML5 game development toolset at Google I/O a few months back. We had a few existing demos of simple games that we had made in order to test the platform.\\n\\nHowever, we really wanted to show something a little more high-end, to showcase the possibilities that HTML5 offers for next-generation browser games. With a little under two weeks to go we started work on the demo we\'d feature on the show floor. A networked multiplayer 3rd-person shooter we descriptively called \'scifi\'. We\u2019ve since renamed it to the slightly less descriptive D.E.M.O.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n[Try playing D.E.M.O. now](https://playcanv.as/p/UAR6UQNM/).\\n\\n_**Firefox:** Hiding the mouse cursor only works in Fullscreen mode, press SPACE to toggle fullscreen._\\n\\nWe think the result is something is pretty special so we\u2019re sharing it with you today. We think you\u2019ll agree that it heralds the beginning of a new generation of HTML5 games.\\n\\nWe also wanted to talk about how using PlayCanvas allowed us to make D.E.M.O. in around 2 weeks. A staggeringly short time for any game, and it really shows off the power of collaborative development and great tools.\\n\\nThe game and the PlayCanvas Engine are written entirely in JavaScript. It\u2019s pushing at the boundaries of the browser gaming using the latest HTML5 APIs, including:\\n\\n- WebGL for the graphics;\\n- Web Audio API for sound;\\n- WebSockets for networking;\\n- Gamepad API for controller input;\\n- PointerLock API to hide the mouse cursor;\\n- Fullscreen API to give you an immersive experience;\\n\\nD.E.M.O. was built on top of the [PlayCanvas Engine](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine), which provides graphics, audio, input handling, etc. The game itself is a few thousand lines of JavaScript, the [source code](http://bitbucket.org/playcanvas/scifi) is available if you want to take a closer look. We also wrote a simple server which runs a WebSocket server powered by [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) to set up games and redirect messages to connected clients. The [source code](http://bitbucket.org/playcanvas/scifi-server) for this is available too.\\n\\n## How was it built?\\n\\nTwo weeks is very short time to build an app like D.E.M.O. and along with lots of long hours coding we were only able to do this thanks to the PlayCanvas platform that we\u2019ve built, so we want to share with some of the ways which it saved us time, and can save you time too.\\n\\n### Asset wrangling\\n\\n![SWAT Model](/img/swat_in_tools.jpg)  \\n_Side-by-side rendering in 3DS Max and PlayCanvas Engine_\\n\\nWe\u2019ve made a beautiful looking game in 3D in next to no time. We could do this because the PlayCanvas asset tools are built to ingest a wide range of model formats and set up to ensure that default materials from popular 3D packages appear identical in engine as they do for the artist.\\n\\nThe sci-fi levels and the SWAT character and animations were all created using 3D Studio Max default materials. With no effort on our part we could export the source assets into the PlayCanvas format and be sure they would look nearly identical at runtime. If you were to get assets from a site like [Turbo Squid](https://www.turbosquid.com/) you need to know that it will _just work_ in PlayCanvas without modification. Within minutes of receiving 3D assets from a 3rd party you can have characters and environments in game.\\n\\n### Building the level\\n\\n![D.E.M.O.](/img/demo-designer.jpg)  \\n_Building the D.E.M.O. in PlayCanvas Designer_\\n\\nTraditionally, this would consist of building out the level in low detail (often called grey-boxing) and running about it in to get feel for the how the game plays, where the choke points are and how the spawn points should be placed. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t have the art resources to design the level in this way but we did have a set of 5 or 6 components which fitted together like jigsaw pieces.\\n\\nEven though there was a limited choice of level design, both Will and I wanted to be involved in the discussion over the how level should look. As we were working around 50 miles apart, getting together around a laptop screen wasn\u2019t going to be possible. Fortunately the PlayCanvas Designer is the perfect solution for this type of collaborative work. We are able to simultaneously view the same level and while talking face-to-face over Skype, we could both position the pieces in real-time and discuss the pros and cons of each configuration.\\n\\nWe had a pretty simple task to complete but we were miles apart and using the Designer meant that we had no problem collaborating despite this. It\u2019s clear to us that scaling this up to a design team would be incredibly liberating and will really change the way that games are made.\\n\\n### Cloud Development\\n\\nBy the time of the conference, development on the demo had nearly finished and we had a few hours to set up our booth. Google kindly provided a MacBook Pro and one of their new fancy Chromebooks for us to demo on. Our plan was to run the PlayCanvas Designer on each machine along with a live running build of the game. That way we could demonstrate how editing data on one machine would update instantly in both the Designer view on the other machine and the live games running on each machine.\\n\\nTotal set up time for installing tools and getting up and running on both machines? Under a minute, simply open Chrome and navigate to a url. This is possible because of cloud development. Every part of the process is based in the cloud: the tools, the assets and the code.\\n\\n### Help us, help you\\n\\nThe service we\u2019re building at PlayCanvas is designed to make creating games faster and more accessible. We\'re building games ourselves in ways that we wouldn\u2019t have thought possible a few years ago and we want you to do that too.\\n\\nIf you are interested in trying out PlayCanvas to build your games, get in touch, email us at [info@playcanvas.com](mailto:info@playcanvas.com) to join the Beta trial.\\n\\n### [Play the game](https://playcanv.as/p/UAR6UQNM/)\\n\\nTry out D.E.M.O for yourselves. We\u2019ve divided it into multiple 3-player games, you will join the first free game. It should run in any browser that supports WebGL."},{"id":"new-feature-github-and-private-repository-support","metadata":{"permalink":"/new-feature-github-and-private-repository-support","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2012-07-25-new-feature-github-and-private-repository-support.md","source":"@site/blog/2012-07-25-new-feature-github-and-private-repository-support.md","title":"New Feature: GitHub and private repository support","description":"GitHub Octocat","date":"2012-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.31,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Evans","title":"CTO","page":{"permalink":"/authors/dave"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/daredevildave","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewevans/","github":"https://github.com/daredevildave"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/daredevildave.png","key":"dave"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"dave","slug":"new-feature-github-and-private-repository-support","title":"New Feature: GitHub and private repository support"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Making a multiplayer 3rd-person shooter in HTML5","permalink":"/a-multiplayer-3rd-person-shooter-in-html5"},"nextItem":{"title":"PlayCanvas @ Google I/O","permalink":"/playcanvas-google-io"}},"content":"![GitHub Octocat](https://github.com/github/media/raw/master/octocats/octocat.png)\\n\\nGoogle I/O certainly kept us busy last month, but we\'ve still found the time to keep pushing out those features.\\n\\nThis weeks big ticket item is integration with GitHub and support for private repositories on both Bitbucket and GitHub.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Don\'t reinvent sliced bread\\n\\nWhen we started developing PlayCanvas, we knew that we wanted to change the way games are made, but we didn\'t want to reinvent everything.

It\'s a professional 3D game engine, a toolset that takes real-time collaboration seriously and a publishing system for getting your game out to the world.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nYou can see more details about exactly what we\'re offering on our [Technology Overview](https://playcanvas.com/features) page.\\n\\n## Why are you making PlayCanvas?\\n\\nWe think that the web is awesome, and that the browser is the future of the OS. So what is the first thing you want to do in a new platform? Write games of course! Tools for making games in the browser have so far been limited to 2 dimensions, and we want people to make next-generation games with hardware accelerated 3D graphics.\\n\\n## Why is PlayCanvas exciting?\\n\\nFirst off, PlayCanvas provides a professional standard 3D game engine, written by people with years of PC and console game engine experience. This means that people who want to make the browser games of the future don\'t need to re-invent all the low-level stuff and worry about cross-browser compatibility. Exciting because now anyone who can program JavaScript can make really high quality graphics render straight into the browser.\\n\\nSecondly, tools. As anyone who has done any serious game development knows, tools are the most important part of your game technology. A fancy engine means nothing if no one can get artwork into it, or your designers have to manually edit XML files to change behaviors. The PlayCanvas Designer is a our key tool which allows you to build your game visually with a WYSIWYG interface.\\n\\nHowever, most exciting is the real-time collaboration features. It is truly revolutionary to be able to work with a colleague on the other side of world and edit 3D worlds in real-time as if you were drawing on the same sheet of paper. Seriously, you have to try it.\\n\\n## When is it going to be ready?\\n\\nWe\'re building games with PlayCanvas right now, so in some senses, it\'s good to go. But scaling up to let the entire world use the platform is a big task and we\'re not quite there yet. We\'re operating a beta test, so if you\'re mega-keen you should sign up for the newsletter and contact us to let us know how you plan to use PlayCanvas for your next project.\\n\\nTeam PlayCanvas"},{"id":"hello-world","metadata":{"permalink":"/hello-world","editUrl":"https://github.com/playcanvas/blog/tree/main/blog/2012-02-12-hello-world.md","source":"@site/blog/2012-02-12-hello-world.md","title":"Hello World","description":"Welcome to the PlayCanvas blog (and the new look website!).","date":"2012-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.805,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Will Eastcott","title":"CEO","description":"Will Eastcott is an entrepreneur and veteran technologist of the games industry with experience at EA, Sony, and Activision.

The tools are online, ready and waiting for you to build your next gaming masterpiece.
